1
00:00:21,718 --> 00:00:25,930
<i>This is not the most inspiring
choice for vice president, right?</i>

2
00:00:25,971 --> 00:00:29,266
<i>A well-respected operator,</i>
<i>pragmatic, but let's face it,</i>

3
00:00:29,266 --> 00:00:32,185
<i>this is probably just a nod
to Congress, tapping one of their own.</i>

4
00:00:32,185 --> 00:00:36,690
<i>It's really nothing more than
a placeholder until 2016, assuredly.</i>

5
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,151
<i>I'm not surprised he's doing</i>
<i>a private swearing-in.</i>

6
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:42,112
<i>My bet is the president wants to draw
as little attention to this as possible.</i>

7
00:00:42,112 --> 00:00:44,906
<i>There's just</i>
<i>no real wow factor...</i>

8
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,581
Christina's working out well?

9
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:55,167
She's getting her sea legs, but
I've been happy so far.

10
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:57,252
- She works hard.
- It's a big load off my shoulders

11
00:00:57,252 --> 00:00:59,713
when she can travel with the
president instead of me.

12
00:00:59,713 --> 00:01:02,716
I get so much more done
when I stay here.

13
00:01:04,384 --> 00:01:06,595
President have a preference
in the whip's race?

14
00:01:06,595 --> 00:01:08,430
I can't believe how ugly
it's gotten.

15
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,223
He was more disappointed
than anything else...

16
00:01:10,223 --> 00:01:13,018
- Watch out, Wes.
- I hope I'm not interrupting.

17
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:14,978
- Not at all.
- This is something else.

18
00:01:14,978 --> 00:01:17,105
Security specs. They had
to work fast. Watch yourself.

19
00:01:17,105 --> 00:01:18,857
It's like a war zone
around here.

20
00:01:18,857 --> 00:01:21,026
The idea is to keep
the war from getting in.

21
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:22,986
How's the whip's race coming,
Congressman?

22
00:01:22,986 --> 00:01:24,446
It's tight between
you and Howard?

23
00:01:24,446 --> 00:01:25,906
Well, you'd have to ask Howard,

24
00:01:25,906 --> 00:01:28,116
if he's not too busy
trying to sodomize me.

25
00:01:28,116 --> 00:01:31,119
- Should we go say hello? - For God sakes,
don't make me talk to that man.

26
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,876
- Good to see you, Howard.
- Nice to see you, Wes.

27
00:01:37,876 --> 00:01:40,879
Yeah, I bet it is.

28
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,185
- Bob.
- Frank.

29
00:01:55,185 --> 00:01:56,853
- Thanks for inviting me, Frank.
- What?

30
00:01:56,853 --> 00:01:58,688
- Thanks for inviting me.
- You bet.

31
00:01:58,688 --> 00:02:04,152
- Hey, Frank.
- Judge! Good to see you.

32
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:06,988
- Is there somewhere I can go to change?
- Yes, absolutely.

33
00:02:06,988 --> 00:02:09,741
There's room down the hall.
Doug, will you take care of the judge?

34
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:11,868
And when he's ready,
let's get this thing over with.

35
00:02:11,868 --> 00:02:13,495
I'll start bringing 'em in.

36
00:02:13,495 --> 00:02:15,497
"That I take this
obligation freely,

37
00:02:15,497 --> 00:02:19,000
without any mental reservation
or purpose of evasion..."

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,794
That I take
this obligation freely,

39
00:02:20,794 --> 00:02:23,130
without any mental reservation
or purpose of evasion...

40
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,631
"...and that I will..."

41
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:26,299
One heartbeat away
from the presidency,

42
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:28,635
and not a single
vote cast in my name.

43
00:02:28,635 --> 00:02:32,472
- Democracy is so overrated.
- "...on which I am about to enter,

44
00:02:32,472 --> 00:02:35,517
- so help me God."
- ...and that I will well and faithfully

45
00:02:35,517 --> 00:02:40,856
discharge the duties of the office on
which I am about to enter, so help me God.

46
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:44,901
- Congratulations,
Mr. Vice President.

47
00:02:55,787 --> 00:02:58,665
All right, let's get back
to running the country.

48
00:02:58,707 --> 00:04:33,510
<font color="#3399CC">Subtitles by </font><font color="ffffff">MemoryOnSmells</font>
<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>

49
00:04:33,552 --> 00:04:35,887
Now, one of you is
gonna replace me as the whip.

50
00:04:35,887 --> 00:04:38,265
You're the two frontrunners
and we know you both want it.

51
00:04:38,265 --> 00:04:40,559
You're not behaving
like men who belong in the leadership.

52
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:42,978
We need to tone
down the rhetoric.

53
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:45,355
- You're hurting the party.
- I'm just responding

54
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:46,898
to the lies Howard's
been slinging.

55
00:04:46,898 --> 00:04:49,192
Those junkets happened, Wes.
I'm not making it up.

56
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:51,570
- And nepotism's any better?
- That's just not true and you know it.

57
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,989
Your sister's husband happened
to be appointed state treasurer?

58
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:55,574
Ex-husband. And yes.

59
00:04:55,574 --> 00:04:57,325
That is such
a load of crap, Howard.

60
00:04:57,325 --> 00:04:59,286
Gentlemen, Bob is right.

61
00:04:59,286 --> 00:05:01,413
This sort of catfighting
gets out in the press,

62
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:04,207
whichever one of you wins
hits the ground limping.

63
00:05:04,207 --> 00:05:09,671
Let's keep it clean and bring some civility
back to the House. Can we agree to that?

64
00:05:12,758 --> 00:05:14,676
I'd feel a lot better
if you shook hands on it.

65
00:05:21,308 --> 00:05:23,351
Thank you.

66
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,444
I'm with him right now,
Christina.

67
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:34,613
I'm off. I'll swing
by your office later.

68
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:37,240
Don't. It's not ready yet.
I'll be working from here.

69
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,534
- What?
- Tusk is in town.

70
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:41,953
He's meeting with the president
in 45 minutes. Christina just told me.

71
00:05:41,953 --> 00:05:44,289
- The Joint Commission talks.
- That's what she said.

72
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:46,750
- Christina's proving useful.
- We'll stay in touch.

73
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,378
Get me Cathy Durant.
Your people coming by?

74
00:05:49,378 --> 00:05:52,881
Just my new chief of staff.
That's all I've got until we hire more.

75
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:56,468
So how's it feel to be married
to the vice president?

76
00:05:56,468 --> 00:06:00,222
Exactly
the same... just louder.

77
00:06:00,222 --> 00:06:02,432
Secretary Durant.

78
00:06:02,432 --> 00:06:03,600
Cathy.

79
00:06:06,395 --> 00:06:08,146
Raymond.

80
00:06:09,898 --> 00:06:12,317
Congratulations,
Mr. Vice President.

81
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:16,780
Thank you very much.
May I please introduce Secretary Durant.

82
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,409
- A pleasure, Madame Secretary.
- Hi.

83
00:06:20,409 --> 00:06:25,247
Well, this is quite a surprise.
I had no idea you were in town.

84
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:27,666
Ah...

85
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,418
Well...

86
00:06:44,725 --> 00:06:46,893
Morning, sir.

87
00:06:46,893 --> 00:06:49,146
- Mr. President.
- Catherine.

88
00:06:49,146 --> 00:06:52,607
- We just happened to run into Raymond.
- Huh!

89
00:06:52,607 --> 00:06:55,902
Wonderful. Come on in.

90
00:06:58,363 --> 00:07:00,657
The phone records will
absolutely prove I'm right.

91
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:02,325
There were no phone records.
You know that.

92
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:04,202
The data history,
with the carrier.

93
00:07:04,202 --> 00:07:06,329
Even if we got the case reopened,
which isn't gonna happen,

94
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:09,541
you have any idea how hard it
is to get a warrant for phone data?

95
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,210
Probable cause.
Bring him in for questioning.

96
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,005
- Technically, you have jurisdiction.
- The vice president?

97
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:18,091
I know this all sounds preposterous
to you, but if you go through my notes...

98
00:07:18,091 --> 00:07:21,470
- We've been through your notes.
- You've listened, but you haven't heard me.

99
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,306
Circumstantial,
yes, but plausible.

100
00:07:24,306 --> 00:07:27,601
I know you've
reopened cases on less.

101
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:31,104
This has gotta stop, man.
We keep having the same conversation.

102
00:07:31,104 --> 00:07:33,273
It can't be an accident.

103
00:07:36,276 --> 00:07:41,865
OK, I'm gonna
show you something.

104
00:07:41,865 --> 00:07:46,912
CNN tried to get ahold of this,
we 86'd it out of respect to the family.

105
00:07:46,912 --> 00:07:48,830
The footage?

106
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:56,088
- It's not easy to watch.
- I want to see it.

107
00:08:00,842 --> 00:08:04,721
She tripped, or jumped.

108
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:09,101
She didn't jump.

109
00:08:13,397 --> 00:08:15,524
Here it is, frame by frame.

110
00:08:30,622 --> 00:08:35,001
Now, there were two witnesses.
One was a 70-year-old woman
with macular degeneration.

111
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:37,713
All she saw was a blur.
The second was the conductor of the train.

112
00:08:37,713 --> 00:08:40,757
He said it looked like she fell.
Between those two and this video,

113
00:08:40,757 --> 00:08:43,593
that's all there is.

114
00:08:43,593 --> 00:08:50,058
You can watch it a million
times, but this case is closed.

115
00:08:50,058 --> 00:08:53,395
We should limit the agenda
to a couple of key issues:

116
00:08:53,395 --> 00:08:56,773
import tariffs on industrial
manufactured goods,

117
00:08:56,773 --> 00:08:59,985
and export quotas
on rare earth elements.

118
00:08:59,985 --> 00:09:02,571
They're using both
as political levers.

119
00:09:02,571 --> 00:09:05,532
I agree these are two areas where we can
make meaningful progress.

120
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:08,452
But I'm worried about the rise
in corporate cyberattacks.

121
00:09:08,452 --> 00:09:13,165
- That's a rabbit hole.
- We have to address it sooner or later.

122
00:09:13,165 --> 00:09:15,625
It's just a matter of whether
we want to address it now.

123
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:20,756
Chinese don't like surprises.
All I'm proposing is that we
use the Joint Commission talks

124
00:09:20,756 --> 00:09:23,717
to bring it up gently now,
set the stage for the next round.

125
00:09:23,717 --> 00:09:25,594
Look, I'm a businessman,
not a diplomat.

126
00:09:25,594 --> 00:09:29,931
But I'm a businessman with
35 years' experience working in China.

127
00:09:29,931 --> 00:09:32,267
When they come to the table,
you don't get greedy.

128
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:35,145
You're working on a co-venture
refinery project in Fujian.

129
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:37,189
Which would be
the first of its kind.

130
00:09:37,189 --> 00:09:40,233
Open the gateway
for increased investment...

131
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:42,903
Cyberattacks
threaten those co-ventures.

132
00:09:42,903 --> 00:09:46,490
There's less a need for them
if the Chinese can obtain new technology

133
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,076
- from corporate espionage.
- Frank, what do you think?

134
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:50,994
I lean more toward
Raymond's thinking.

135
00:09:50,994 --> 00:09:54,081
If we antagonize the Chinese,
we could undo years of progress.

136
00:09:54,081 --> 00:09:58,835
Allow me to do this quietly, with a
soft touch. I won't antagonize them, sir.

137
00:09:58,835 --> 00:10:01,213
The last thing we want to do
is rock the boat.

138
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:02,756
What do you have
in mind, Catherine?

139
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:06,009
A suggested agenda,
not a demand.

140
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:10,013
We'll keep it mid-level.
I won't get anywhere near it.

141
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:13,433
- Raymond?
- I've voiced my concerns.

142
00:10:17,354 --> 00:10:20,482
- A very soft touch.
- You have my word, sir.

143
00:10:20,482 --> 00:10:22,150
Good.

144
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,364
Raymond, you want
to grab some lunch?

145
00:10:28,532 --> 00:10:30,951
- Would love to.
- Thanks, Frank.

146
00:10:30,951 --> 00:10:34,496
- Welcome to the West Wing.
- Thank you, sir.

147
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,047
The president is like a lone
tree in an empty field.

148
00:10:44,047 --> 00:10:46,341
He leans whichever way
the wind is blowing.

149
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:50,971
And right now, Raymond Tusk
blows far too strong from the West.

150
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:53,306
- Is that a wig?
- No.

151
00:10:53,306 --> 00:10:56,601
- He's been growing it out for months.
- Here, this way.

152
00:10:56,601 --> 00:10:59,271
Diane says she likes it long.

153
00:10:59,271 --> 00:11:04,860
I told her she'll feel differently
once she sees the first dreadlock or...

154
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,903
- ...smells it.
- Oh!

155
00:11:09,281 --> 00:11:11,450
I went to see your
daughter last weekend.

156
00:11:14,036 --> 00:11:16,288
- How is she?
- You want to see a picture?

157
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:18,457
OK.

158
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,961
- Was her mother there?
- Yeah.

159
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,422
Are they OK on money?

160
00:11:25,422 --> 00:11:27,758
The rate at Greenwoods
is going up in January.

161
00:11:27,758 --> 00:11:31,053
Catalina's worried
she's gonna be short.

162
00:11:31,053 --> 00:11:33,430
I'll make sure to put
more into the account.

163
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,307
We don't have to talk
about her if you don't want.

164
00:11:35,307 --> 00:11:38,935
No, no, no, it's fine.
I appreciate you going to see her.

165
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:41,646
I'm sorry, Ted, I thought that
when you asked me to lunch,

166
00:11:41,646 --> 00:11:45,233
- it was because you...
- No, no, no. I mean... yes.

167
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:50,030
I want to make sure they
have what they need. But no.

168
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:54,117
The reason I wanted to talk...

169
00:11:55,619 --> 00:11:58,914
- Lorrie Tate.
- Lorrie's a friend of mine.

170
00:11:58,914 --> 00:12:01,083
What about her?

171
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:04,336
She mentioned you were
interested in the whip's race.

172
00:12:04,336 --> 00:12:08,215
Oh, no.
Oh, I wish she hadn't.

173
00:12:08,215 --> 00:12:12,344
- Why not?
- Because it's ridiculous.

174
00:12:12,344 --> 00:12:13,845
Is it?

175
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,017
I just mentioned it offhand.

176
00:12:19,017 --> 00:12:21,770
The whole Webb and Buchwalter
thing, it's just...

177
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,481
- Complete mess.
- But I wasn't serious.

178
00:12:24,481 --> 00:12:28,068
I think you should be serious.
Do you want to do it?

179
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:30,404
I don't have the experience,
Ted. And I don't...

180
00:12:30,404 --> 00:12:33,281
- Yes or no?
- Yes, of course.

181
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:37,202
Someday. But now?
I don't have the money they do.

182
00:12:37,202 --> 00:12:40,831
- Unless you use mine.
- You can't waste your money on...

183
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,835
If I funnel my PAC money
to some folks who are on the fence,

184
00:12:44,835 --> 00:12:48,004
round up a couple dozen
commitments before you announce,

185
00:12:48,004 --> 00:12:53,260
that would make you an instant contender.
Now, tell me that's a waste.

186
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,387
We're talking
hundreds of thousands.

187
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:57,889
It's not a Christmas present,
Jackie.

188
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:00,809
With you as whip, I have
a strong ally in the leadership.

189
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:06,440
I stand to gain as much as you.
Now, hang on one second.

190
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,109
I don't know where the...

191
00:13:11,194 --> 00:13:12,904
<i>How did it go?</i>
<i>Did he buy it?</i>

192
00:13:12,904 --> 00:13:16,158
Whatever bug you put in his ear,
it burrowed deep.

193
00:13:16,158 --> 00:13:18,910
It was easy. The man adores
you like you're his own child.

194
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,705
But you sure as hell better
make me chief deputy.

195
00:13:21,705 --> 00:13:26,168
- I need to win first.
- Ted and I make two, 111 to go.

196
00:13:26,168 --> 00:13:28,920
It's always good when the chief deputy
knows her arithmetic.

197
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,715
Fuck off.
Let's start taking names.

198
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:35,927
- This one seems promising.
- Connor Ellis. He's solid.

199
00:13:35,927 --> 00:13:39,598
- Good experience. - He's the one that
got Senator Jones out of that mess

200
00:13:39,598 --> 00:13:43,101
- with the push-polling.
- Yes. Kept him from the Ethics Committee.

201
00:13:43,101 --> 00:13:46,813
- Let's set up an interview.
- I'll find a good time in the schedule.

202
00:13:46,813 --> 00:13:50,901
Let's talk about the schedule.
I think we need to be...

203
00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:53,737
...more selective
with the events I do.

204
00:13:53,737 --> 00:13:58,200
Some of these are leftovers from
Mrs. Matthews. We can
cancel whatever you like.

205
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,285
And what's this?

206
00:14:00,285 --> 00:14:03,538
Your husband will be pinning stars
on two newly commissioned Marine generals.

207
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:06,875
- I think that's one you should do.
- OK, walk me through it.

208
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:10,754
The generals are Alicia Hampton
and Dalton McGinnis.

209
00:14:10,754 --> 00:14:13,965
- Arriving at 6:50...
- Dalton McGinnis?

210
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:16,385
Yes. Do you know him?

211
00:14:20,347 --> 00:14:23,809
We went to college together.

212
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:26,853
I'm sorry. Where were we?
Um, arrive what time?

213
00:14:26,853 --> 00:14:28,814
- Six-fifty.
- Great. I'd like a list

214
00:14:28,814 --> 00:14:30,774
of all the people
that will be attending.

215
00:14:30,774 --> 00:14:33,568
It's not that big a deal
if I get left out,

216
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:35,696
but you're
the secretary of state.

217
00:14:35,696 --> 00:14:38,115
I mean, Tusk should not
be determining policy.

218
00:14:38,115 --> 00:14:41,576
The president alone should
instruct you on what you are to pursue.

219
00:14:41,576 --> 00:14:44,788
- What's their relationship?
- He's has had his ear for years.

220
00:14:44,788 --> 00:14:47,207
- An advisor...
- More of a mentor.

221
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:49,376
And one whose advice
is not easily dismissed.

222
00:14:49,376 --> 00:14:51,461
He's gonna keep pushing back
on cyberwarfare.

223
00:14:51,461 --> 00:14:55,632
- Not if I get it on the agenda.
- Especially if you get it on the agenda.

224
00:14:55,632 --> 00:14:57,509
Tusk is not gonna
take any chances

225
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:00,178
when the next Joint Commission
talks come around.

226
00:15:00,178 --> 00:15:01,888
You agreed with him
in the meeting.

227
00:15:01,888 --> 00:15:04,766
If we had ganged up, he would've taken
a firmer position.

228
00:15:04,766 --> 00:15:08,812
For all we know, he's convincing
the president right now to change his mind.

229
00:15:08,812 --> 00:15:12,607
Now, we need to remove
that option as a possibility.

230
00:15:12,607 --> 00:15:17,988
- How? - Force the Chinese to
confront the issue now,

231
00:15:17,988 --> 00:15:21,408
- this round of talks.
- I promised the president a soft touch.

232
00:15:21,408 --> 00:15:25,704
- I can't intentionally break my promise.
- What if it was unintentional?

233
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:33,712
Cathy, if you don't like how
the table is set, turn over the table.

234
00:15:37,883 --> 00:15:41,053
- You're cheating.
- No, I'm not. It's vapor.

235
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:43,930
- Still.
- You should try it.

236
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:49,352
- Addiction without the consequences.
- It's all yours.

237
00:15:49,352 --> 00:15:51,396
You staying up?

238
00:15:52,606 --> 00:15:54,900
This ceremony tomorrow night.

239
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,819
- You don't want to go.
- If I don't have to.

240
00:15:57,819 --> 00:15:59,738
I hate these
sort of things, too,

241
00:15:59,738 --> 00:16:03,492
but it is my first public
appearance as vice president.

242
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:08,163
- OK.
- Thank you.

243
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:15,587
Should we turn this
into a proper office?

244
00:16:15,587 --> 00:16:20,467
That's not a bad idea.
No privacy downstairs.

245
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:22,928
I'll talk to the contractor.

246
00:16:22,928 --> 00:16:26,223
- Good night, Francis.
- Good night.

247
00:16:47,452 --> 00:16:51,164
Sir, sir!<i> Congressional Record.</i>
Weren't the talks supposed to go until six?

248
00:16:51,164 --> 00:16:54,000
- We can't talk if they won't listen.
- Did the Chinese walk out?

249
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,128
We made it clear that we won't
discuss any other issues

250
00:16:56,128 --> 00:16:58,922
until government-sponsored
cyberattacks are on the table.

251
00:16:58,922 --> 00:17:01,007
That's not what
they wanted to hear.

252
00:17:01,007 --> 00:17:03,301
Sir, what did you tell the Chinese
delegation before they walked out?

253
00:17:03,301 --> 00:17:06,638
We didn't have anybody there.
The Joint Commission's
usually a snooze fest.

254
00:17:06,638 --> 00:17:09,057
- Not today, it wasn't.
- I've got Greer on it.

255
00:17:09,057 --> 00:17:11,017
Isn't this international?

256
00:17:11,017 --> 00:17:12,978
We need somebody from the tech
beat if we want any background

257
00:17:12,978 --> 00:17:15,981
- on cyberwarfare.
- Does he have anybody on record yet?

258
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:18,400
The Chinese aren't talking.
And all the US delegation said

259
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,319
- is what's in the AP wire.
- I want something online in two hours.

260
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:24,156
In-depth follow-up
sometime this week.

261
00:17:25,657 --> 00:17:30,996
Hey, Lucas... you all right?

262
00:17:30,996 --> 00:17:32,956
Yeah, why?

263
00:17:32,956 --> 00:17:36,293
You're wearing the same
clothes you wore yesterday.

264
00:17:36,293 --> 00:17:38,503
Am I?

265
00:17:38,503 --> 00:17:41,381
I don't know what's going on
in your personal life,

266
00:17:41,381 --> 00:17:45,177
but it seems to be entering the
workplace. Appearances matter.

267
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:49,056
We can't have an editor looking
more disheveled than his reporters.

268
00:17:49,056 --> 00:17:51,808
Two hours.
You'll have something.

269
00:17:51,808 --> 00:17:53,894
Did you know Jackie
Sharp's running for whip?

270
00:17:53,894 --> 00:17:57,147
- No, it's the first I'm hearing of it.
- I spoke to Webb.

271
00:17:57,147 --> 00:18:01,360
He got an e-mail from Lorrie Tate about
me. I got one from Dave Holland about him.

272
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,571
- Which means nothing to me.
- The junkets, the nepotism.

273
00:18:04,571 --> 00:18:08,200
Tate and Sharp are close. Holland serves
on the VA Committee with her.

274
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,826
She used proxies
to insulate herself.

275
00:18:09,826 --> 00:18:11,995
You think she gave
the dirt to them.

276
00:18:11,995 --> 00:18:14,456
- She's been playing both of us.
- How many commitments you think

277
00:18:14,456 --> 00:18:16,750
- she could have?
- Around 20 so far.

278
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,211
- So she's a distant third.
- But she's picking people off us

279
00:18:19,211 --> 00:18:22,339
- left and right. I want your help.
- You have my support, Wes.

280
00:18:22,339 --> 00:18:26,551
- Then make that public. - If I come out
for you, Birch comes out for Webb.

281
00:18:26,551 --> 00:18:29,096
- That's gonna hurt you, not help you.
- This is serious, Frank.

282
00:18:29,096 --> 00:18:31,390
Ted Havemeyer
is bankrolling her.

283
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,308
- Have you thought of talking to Jackie?
- No, no.

284
00:18:33,308 --> 00:18:36,228
- I can't do that on principle.
- Why not?

285
00:18:36,228 --> 00:18:39,356
Anyone who Havemeyer is backing,
I don't work with.

286
00:18:39,356 --> 00:18:41,441
He pulled this same crap on me
when I ran for Senate.

287
00:18:41,441 --> 00:18:44,027
He financed my primary opponent.
Asshole.

288
00:18:44,027 --> 00:18:46,655
Well, that is your call.
But if you're gonna let an old grudge

289
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,990
- get in the way of progress...
- I just can't do it, Frank.

290
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,618
Havemeyer's been trying to shove
me down the totem pole for years.

291
00:18:51,618 --> 00:18:53,537
I won't give him
the satisfaction.

292
00:18:53,537 --> 00:18:57,040
Well, I can respect that,
but my hands are tied.

293
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,711
It's a delicate matter, but we are in
communication with the Chinese government

294
00:19:00,711 --> 00:19:03,004
- as to how to move forward.
- This mean the US will back down

295
00:19:03,004 --> 00:19:05,340
- on cyberattacks?
- The United States never backs down,

296
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,427
particularly on issues
that are high priority to us.

297
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:12,848
Madame Secretary, what did you
tell the head of the delegation?

298
00:19:16,184 --> 00:19:18,228
The delegation
overstepped its bounds.

299
00:19:18,228 --> 00:19:20,605
But Cathy couldn't throw her
own people under the bus.

300
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:23,233
She should've consulted
us first before speaking publicly.

301
00:19:23,233 --> 00:19:26,069
The press was on her doorstep and
the president was in another hemisphere.

302
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:29,573
Look, I'm not condoning
what she did, but she had to do something.

303
00:19:29,573 --> 00:19:32,117
She made a gut call
and she acted.

304
00:19:32,117 --> 00:19:33,744
We have to distance
ourselves from this.

305
00:19:33,744 --> 00:19:35,871
- When is the president back?
- Tomorrow morning.

306
00:19:35,871 --> 00:19:37,205
Can we set up a meeting?

307
00:19:37,205 --> 00:19:38,999
Cathy needs
to publicly apologize.

308
00:19:38,999 --> 00:19:40,667
We get her in the room
with the president?

309
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:42,794
Shouldn't we all be
on the same page first?

310
00:19:42,794 --> 00:19:44,755
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.

311
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:47,215
Now, you asked me a question
before I went and got my food

312
00:19:47,215 --> 00:19:50,135
- and I've forgotten what...
- Mr. Vice President. General McGinnis.

313
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:53,472
Ah. It's a great honor. I hope
you don't mind, the president
wishes he could be here.

314
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:55,599
- He's asked me to fill in.
- The honor is mine, sir.

315
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,686
- And, General, this is my wife Claire.
- It's good to see you, Claire.

316
00:19:59,686 --> 00:20:01,938
- It's been a long time.
- Yes.

317
00:20:01,938 --> 00:20:04,816
- Harvard. We were classmates.
- Claire didn't say a thing.

318
00:20:04,816 --> 00:20:09,488
We dated for a time.
Well, about five minutes.

319
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:11,490
Anyway, I'll let you
get back to your meal.

320
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,909
Thank you. I've remembered.

321
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:18,246
Interestingly enough, in South Carolinam,
the largest crop is not cotton.

322
00:20:18,246 --> 00:20:23,001
No. It's tobacco.
And the third largest crop is marijuana.

323
00:20:23,001 --> 00:20:24,878
Now...

324
00:20:24,878 --> 00:20:27,130
We'll just keep
that to ourselves.

325
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,299
Would you all excuse me
for just a moment?

326
00:20:30,384 --> 00:20:32,010
- Is she alone?
- Yes.

327
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,429
Will you give us
a few moments, please.

328
00:20:39,393 --> 00:20:41,353
What's wrong?

329
00:20:43,188 --> 00:20:47,025
- It was him.
- Who?

330
00:20:48,985 --> 00:20:51,154
Freshman year.

331
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:55,617
You mean...?

332
00:20:56,993 --> 00:20:59,830
McGinnis?

333
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,498
Francis. Francis!

334
00:21:01,498 --> 00:21:04,459
Please, don't do anything,
please!

335
00:21:04,459 --> 00:21:06,336
I am not gonna pin
a medal on that man.

336
00:21:06,336 --> 00:21:08,088
- You have to!
- Just a minute, please!

337
00:21:08,088 --> 00:21:10,257
- There is no way...
- They want to start.

338
00:21:10,257 --> 00:21:12,300
Just a minute, please!
He does not deserve a medal.

339
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,137
- That man needs to be taken out and shot!
- I am begging you. Please!

340
00:21:15,137 --> 00:21:19,141
- No! I said just a minute!
- Do not make a scene!

341
00:21:19,141 --> 00:21:21,184
Please!

342
00:21:52,007 --> 00:21:54,885
Tom.

343
00:21:54,885 --> 00:21:57,012
Thanks for coming by.

344
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:05,395
You know, I thought I would miss
this place the moment I stepped inside...

345
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:08,648
...but I don't.

346
00:22:11,485 --> 00:22:13,487
Hope you like Stella.

347
00:22:19,951 --> 00:22:22,454
- Cheers.
- Here's how.

348
00:22:29,795 --> 00:22:34,132
- How are things?
- Ah! They're good.

349
00:22:35,592 --> 00:22:37,511
They're good.

350
00:22:39,554 --> 00:22:43,058
- You're happy?
- I haven't been happy a day in my life.

351
00:22:43,058 --> 00:22:47,938
But I have time now.
To think. To write.

352
00:22:47,938 --> 00:22:51,024
- Been working on a novel.
- Yeah?

353
00:22:51,024 --> 00:22:55,237
Mm. It's absolute shit,
but that's OK.

354
00:22:55,237 --> 00:22:58,323
That's great, Tom.
That's really great.

355
00:22:58,323 --> 00:23:02,828
What's on your mind? I know you
didn't ask me here just to catch up.

356
00:23:18,343 --> 00:23:20,303
Frank Underwood.

357
00:23:20,303 --> 00:23:22,848
On the president's
behalf, it is my great honor

358
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:25,058
to formally recognize
the selection

359
00:23:25,058 --> 00:23:28,270
of General Alicia Hampton
as commander,

360
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,397
United States European Command,

361
00:23:30,397 --> 00:23:33,025
and General Dalton McGinnis
as commander

362
00:23:33,025 --> 00:23:35,569
of the United States
Strategic Command.

363
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:37,946
The United States Marine Corps
has been well served

364
00:23:37,946 --> 00:23:42,909
by these two...
exemplary leaders.

365
00:23:42,909 --> 00:23:46,496
The president and I are grateful
for their continued service.

366
00:23:56,131 --> 00:23:59,342
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

367
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,593
You think I'm insane?

368
00:24:41,593 --> 00:24:44,888
I don't think you're insane.

369
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:51,395
I think you've been through a lot.
You're trying to make sense of it all.

370
00:24:51,395 --> 00:24:55,399
- I know I'm right.
- I'm sure you believe you are.

371
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:57,818
It's a fact that he helped
cover up the DUI.

372
00:24:57,818 --> 00:25:03,073
Imagine if one of your reporters
came to you with this story.

373
00:25:03,073 --> 00:25:05,701
- Could you print a word of it?
- No, but I'd have them keep digging.

374
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:07,911
Would you? If you're
honest with yourself,

375
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:10,163
wouldn't you tell them it
seemed far-fetched?

376
00:25:10,163 --> 00:25:13,417
Your notes aren't convincing.
The police reports don't prove a link.

377
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:16,420
- And the speculative leaps you're making?
- I know.

378
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,882
Hold yourself to the same
standards you hold your staff.

379
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:26,638
You and Zoe
were seeing each other.

380
00:25:28,098 --> 00:25:30,684
I'm assuming. Maybe I'm wrong.

381
00:25:34,896 --> 00:25:36,982
No, we were.

382
00:25:46,825 --> 00:25:50,245
When I lost my first wife,
it didn't add up.

383
00:25:50,245 --> 00:25:53,707
Who dies of breast cancer at 31?

384
00:25:53,707 --> 00:25:58,754
I wanted to sue, doctors,
the hospital, everyone.

385
00:25:58,754 --> 00:26:01,506
I thought they were
hiding something.

386
00:26:02,966 --> 00:26:04,843
No.

387
00:26:04,843 --> 00:26:09,723
Grief demands an answer,
but sometimes there isn't one.

388
00:26:11,266 --> 00:26:16,563
Her life couldn't be saved.
Period.

389
00:26:17,731 --> 00:26:19,566
What do I do?

390
00:26:21,026 --> 00:26:23,362
Would you consider
seeing someone?

391
00:26:23,362 --> 00:26:25,864
There's a therapist who helped
me when Cynthia passed away.

392
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:28,200
- I can put you in touch with...
- No, I don't need to see somebody.

393
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,496
- Lucas.
- I appreciate you coming by, Tom.

394
00:26:33,663 --> 00:26:35,832
Thanks for the beer.

395
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,878
You can call me anytime.

396
00:26:48,261 --> 00:26:50,889
You take care of yourself,
Lucas.

397
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:55,352
I mean it.

398
00:27:06,863 --> 00:27:09,324
Any plans to go elsewhere, sir?

399
00:27:09,324 --> 00:27:11,243
No, we're in
for the night. Thank you.

400
00:27:11,243 --> 00:27:12,994
Yes, sir.

401
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,544
Hey.

402
00:27:23,505 --> 00:27:25,590
I'm tired.

403
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:17,225
Do you need something, sir?

404
00:28:17,225 --> 00:28:21,104
My remote, I wanna play.

405
00:28:21,104 --> 00:28:23,357
It's right over here.

406
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:27,778
Thank you.

407
00:28:34,618 --> 00:28:36,912
Something wrong with the
Internet? I can't get online.

408
00:28:36,912 --> 00:28:40,582
We had to disable the access.
It's not a secure connection.

409
00:28:59,893 --> 00:29:01,978
Would you just
give me a moment, please?

410
00:29:01,978 --> 00:29:05,816
Whenever you're out here,
somebody needs to be with you.

411
00:29:05,816 --> 00:29:09,194
I can't be alone
in my own backyard?

412
00:29:09,194 --> 00:29:12,864
If it were up to me, sir,
but it's not up to me.

413
00:29:18,704 --> 00:29:21,123
OK, Meechum.

414
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,792
You think I don't
want to smash things?

415
00:30:07,586 --> 00:30:11,757
I know what that anger is
more than you can imagine.

416
00:30:14,885 --> 00:30:17,888
- When he was on top of me...
- - We don't have to talk about it.

417
00:30:17,888 --> 00:30:20,182
No, I want to.

418
00:30:23,477 --> 00:30:27,064
When he was on top of me,
I pressed my hand...

419
00:30:29,941 --> 00:30:35,447
...with everything I could,
I pressed it into his face.

420
00:30:35,447 --> 00:30:39,034
I pressed it so hard,
I broke his nose.

421
00:30:39,868 --> 00:30:42,412
That didn't stop him.

422
00:30:44,623 --> 00:30:49,127
He shoved the sheets in my
mouth. I could barely breathe.

423
00:30:55,342 --> 00:31:00,597
Every time I think of her,
pinned down like that,

424
00:31:00,597 --> 00:31:06,645
I strangle her, Francis...
so she doesn't strangle me.

425
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,108
I have to.

426
00:31:11,108 --> 00:31:13,151
We have to.

427
00:31:15,862 --> 00:31:18,407
The alternative is...

428
00:31:19,741 --> 00:31:22,035
...it's unlivable.

429
00:31:26,873 --> 00:31:29,376
You should go to sleep.

430
00:31:32,963 --> 00:31:36,258
I'm not sure if I can.

431
00:31:36,258 --> 00:31:39,344
Then you should
go back downstairs.

432
00:31:55,527 --> 00:31:58,697
You'll still feel
the hate in the morning.

433
00:31:59,781 --> 00:32:01,992
You'll use that.

434
00:32:01,992 --> 00:32:04,578
But not on him.

435
00:32:15,213 --> 00:32:18,383
<i>What did you</i>
<i>communicate, exactly?</i>

436
00:32:18,383 --> 00:32:22,220
I told him to bring up the agenda,
suggest bullet points for the SED,

437
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:26,391
- but make no demands. - And how did that
translate into a direct ultimatum?

438
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:29,978
Well, sometimes my delegates
try to read between the lines.

439
00:32:29,978 --> 00:32:33,440
They know that I need plausible
deniability for diplomatic purposes.

440
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,816
Why didn't you
immediately recant?

441
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,568
In my experience with
the Chinese,

442
00:32:36,568 --> 00:32:39,279
backpedaling makes us
look weak. I had two choices:

443
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,867
lose face or exhibit strength.
I chose the latter.

444
00:32:43,867 --> 00:32:47,579
- All right, I'll be in touch shortly.
- Thank you, sir.

445
00:32:55,754 --> 00:32:58,465
Get me Raymond
on the private line.

446
00:33:02,135 --> 00:33:05,013
- Think she overstepped on purpose?
- Cathy would never disobey.

447
00:33:05,013 --> 00:33:08,433
- Not on purpose.
- Raymond, I've got Frank here.

448
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:11,895
<i>- Just the three of us?</i>
- Just us three. Morning, Raymond.

449
00:33:11,895 --> 00:33:16,775
My contacts in Beijing tell me
the minister of commerce is in a tizzy.

450
00:33:16,775 --> 00:33:20,153
<i>Wants to use this as an excuse</i>
<i>to start clenching fists.</i>

451
00:33:20,153 --> 00:33:22,572
Either I turn my back on Cathy
or I stand behind her.

452
00:33:22,572 --> 00:33:25,742
<i>- It's got to be the former.</i>
- I agree. If you don't apologize,

453
00:33:25,742 --> 00:33:28,578
<i>you go from ruffling feathers</i>
<i>to plucking them.</i>

454
00:33:28,578 --> 00:33:30,914
And the Chinese won't
stand for that, Mr. President.

455
00:33:30,914 --> 00:33:33,291
What about perceived miscommunication
between me and my Cabinet?

456
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:36,420
<i>Mr. President, right now
the goal is to resume the talks.</i>

457
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,463
I wouldn't worry
about perceptions.

458
00:33:38,463 --> 00:33:40,132
<i>Frank is right.</i>
<i>We need to be pragmatic.</i>

459
00:33:40,132 --> 00:33:42,217
Worry about appearances later.

460
00:33:45,721 --> 00:33:48,098
All right, I'll have Catherine
draft an apology.

461
00:33:48,098 --> 00:33:50,726
No, it has to come
from you, Mr. President.

462
00:33:50,726 --> 00:33:53,687
If the apology is to mean anything,
it must come from the White House.

463
00:33:53,687 --> 00:33:56,356
That is certainly
the more likely to succeed.

464
00:33:59,651 --> 00:34:01,153
Fine. I'll do it, then.

465
00:34:01,153 --> 00:34:04,197
<i>- Thank you, Raymond.</i>
- Thank you, Garrett.

466
00:34:05,949 --> 00:34:09,494
Do you hear how he still
uses the President's given name?

467
00:34:09,494 --> 00:34:14,082
And that Walker doesn't flinch
at the lack of respect it implies?

468
00:34:16,793 --> 00:34:21,214
Sir, forgive me if this isn't
the case, but you seem a bit hesitant.

469
00:34:21,214 --> 00:34:24,134
- Why do you say that?
- Well, you've raised a good point

470
00:34:24,134 --> 00:34:26,511
about public perception.
I don't want you to think

471
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:30,640
- that I'm dismissing your concerns
casually. - It's a concern for you, too?

472
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:36,229
- There is some insight into what Cathy
brought up. - Backpedaling as weakness.

473
00:34:38,523 --> 00:34:41,151
Well, it's always a coin toss
with the Chinese.

474
00:34:41,151 --> 00:34:46,031
But sometimes, standing your
ground is better than giving in.

475
00:34:46,031 --> 00:34:49,326
They respect you more
when you show strength.

476
00:34:49,326 --> 00:34:52,537
Are you changing
your mind on this, Frank?

477
00:34:52,537 --> 00:34:57,084
I just think it's important
that you do what you think is best.

478
00:34:57,084 --> 00:35:02,005
The American people voted you
president, not me, not Raymond Tusk.

479
00:35:04,007 --> 00:35:07,052
- I'll let you know what I decide.
- Thank you, sir.

480
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,102
You think she's
Underwood's choice?

481
00:35:15,102 --> 00:35:17,312
He deflected, so it's possible.

482
00:35:24,027 --> 00:35:28,448
You and I, we need
to work together on this, Wes.

483
00:35:28,448 --> 00:35:31,451
- Before we both get screwed.
- I agree.

484
00:35:34,454 --> 00:35:38,959
One of us drops out,
throws support to the other.

485
00:35:38,959 --> 00:35:41,586
That'll dwarf
any following she has.

486
00:35:41,586 --> 00:35:44,756
You want me to drop out.

487
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:47,134
I'll make sure you get my
chairmanship on Appropriations.

488
00:35:50,721 --> 00:35:54,808
All you can offer me is Ethics,
which nobody wants.

489
00:35:58,353 --> 00:36:00,856
Let's put this to bed, Wes.

490
00:36:04,151 --> 00:36:06,028
Webb must have
offered him a deal.

491
00:36:06,028 --> 00:36:07,529
Then we have
to offer a better one.

492
00:36:07,529 --> 00:36:09,072
I'm guessing Appropriations.

493
00:36:09,072 --> 00:36:10,407
There's no way I can top that.

494
00:36:10,407 --> 00:36:12,117
Except for Ways and Means.

495
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,081
I won't let you give your chair
to an ass like Buchwalter.

496
00:36:18,081 --> 00:36:20,876
If you're the whip, you outrank
him and every other chairman.

497
00:36:20,876 --> 00:36:24,004
Screw committees. I'll have a
direct line to the Speaker.

498
00:36:24,004 --> 00:36:28,008
- Don't be stubborn, Jackie.
- You think he'd take it?

499
00:36:28,008 --> 00:36:29,718
He was willing
to take a deal from Webb.

500
00:36:29,718 --> 00:36:32,304
You're the only person
he hates more.

501
00:36:32,304 --> 00:36:36,600
He's a brute,
but he's not an idiot.

502
00:36:44,566 --> 00:36:46,818
Well, I know you're not
refusing out of loyalty.

503
00:36:46,818 --> 00:36:51,114
- True.
- So it's because of Ted.

504
00:36:54,534 --> 00:36:57,829
You think you are hot shit,
don't you?

505
00:36:57,829 --> 00:37:02,501
Can we set egos aside and
talk business like the adults we are?

506
00:37:04,753 --> 00:37:07,964
- I want more than Ways and Means.
- Tell me.

507
00:37:07,964 --> 00:37:12,052
I want Havemeyer gone.
Not just retired...

508
00:37:16,848 --> 00:37:19,101
...politically dead.

509
00:37:19,101 --> 00:37:21,228
That race was 12 years ago.

510
00:37:21,228 --> 00:37:23,814
That was 12 years
I could've been in the Senate.

511
00:37:23,814 --> 00:37:28,777
Revenge? Really?

512
00:37:28,777 --> 00:37:31,113
Not revenge.

513
00:37:32,572 --> 00:37:34,449
Equity.

514
00:37:36,118 --> 00:37:39,830
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- Buchwalter won't budge.

515
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:44,084
You know, there's nothing
I despise more in life than pettiness.

516
00:37:44,084 --> 00:37:47,087
I could approach Webb,
but I don't have enough to offer him.

517
00:37:47,087 --> 00:37:50,507
He'd never drop out.
Too much pride.

518
00:37:50,507 --> 00:37:54,052
- I'm not sure what to do.
- This is my file on Ted.

519
00:37:54,052 --> 00:37:57,139
An illegitimate daughter.
The nanny, of course.

520
00:37:57,139 --> 00:38:01,018
Her name is Emily Rodriguez.
Nineteen, cerebral palsy.

521
00:38:01,018 --> 00:38:03,145
I know about Emily.

522
00:38:05,814 --> 00:38:08,734
- Why are we having this conversation?
- It's complicated.

523
00:38:08,734 --> 00:38:11,903
The daughter? It's very
black-and-white to me.

524
00:38:11,903 --> 00:38:16,283
I've known Ted since I was born.
He and my father were very close.

525
00:38:16,283 --> 00:38:19,286
- Yeah, I'm aware.
- He's always looked out for me.

526
00:38:19,286 --> 00:38:21,997
He got me into West Point.
He funded my first race.

527
00:38:21,997 --> 00:38:24,207
I like Ted. He's always
been a team player.

528
00:38:24,207 --> 00:38:26,835
- It's unfortunate he has this secret.
- It was a mistake.

529
00:38:26,835 --> 00:38:29,212
One he's always regretted.
After she was born,

530
00:38:29,212 --> 00:38:31,965
he asked me to check in on her
because he couldn't.

531
00:38:31,965 --> 00:38:37,179
- Because he trusted me.
- I see.

532
00:38:37,179 --> 00:38:40,432
You came in here knowing
what you had to do,

533
00:38:40,432 --> 00:38:43,226
hoping I would pull a rabbit
out of a hat so you wouldn't have to.

534
00:38:43,226 --> 00:38:48,357
I know the girl. I know her mother.
These people don't deserve this.

535
00:38:48,357 --> 00:38:51,526
I've given you all I can.
Whatever you decide is your prerogative.

536
00:38:51,526 --> 00:38:56,198
- But maybe I misjudged you.
- Ted is family to me.

537
00:38:56,198 --> 00:38:59,951
An adopted daughter,
in lieu of a real one.

538
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:02,913
- Sir, the secretary is here.
- Thank you. Send her in.

539
00:39:02,913 --> 00:39:05,290
Excuse us.

540
00:39:15,759 --> 00:39:17,636
- It's good.
- Not too long?

541
00:39:17,636 --> 00:39:19,930
A little bit, but not much.

542
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:24,267
- This part, three paragraphs in.
- About the phone companies?

543
00:39:24,267 --> 00:39:27,646
- Tell me more. - It's one of
Homeland Security's major concerns.

544
00:39:27,646 --> 00:39:30,315
That the cyberattacks might
infiltrate phone carriers,

545
00:39:30,315 --> 00:39:32,651
get access to millions
of people's data history.

546
00:39:32,651 --> 00:39:35,028
- Like who they called?
- Yeah. Who they called, texted,

547
00:39:35,028 --> 00:39:38,115
what they texted, when,
where they were. Everything.

548
00:39:38,115 --> 00:39:42,202
- And that's possible? - There haven't been
any catastrophic breaches yet.

549
00:39:42,202 --> 00:39:44,871
At least not reported.
But it looks like the Chinese are starting

550
00:39:44,871 --> 00:39:47,582
to recruit mercenaries on the Deep Web
to launch guerilla-type attacks

551
00:39:47,582 --> 00:39:50,085
- that can't be traced back...
- Hold on. The "Deep Web."

552
00:39:50,085 --> 00:39:52,879
- I've heard of that.
- Yeah, no, 96 percent of the Internet

553
00:39:52,879 --> 00:39:55,882
isn't accessible through standard
search engines. Most of it's useless.

554
00:39:55,882 --> 00:39:58,927
But it's where you go to find
anything and everything:

555
00:39:58,927 --> 00:40:03,265
child porn, bitcoin laundering,
mail-order narcotics, hackers for hire.

556
00:40:03,265 --> 00:40:05,892
- How do you access it?
- It's actually pretty easy.

557
00:40:05,892 --> 00:40:08,395
- I could show you if you want.
- Yeah, I'm curious.

558
00:40:08,395 --> 00:40:10,522
- Mind if I...?
- Go ahead.

559
00:40:10,522 --> 00:40:12,399
First thing you need's Tor.

560
00:40:12,399 --> 00:40:15,652
Some people prefer I2P,
but I think Tor is better.

561
00:40:15,652 --> 00:40:20,657
- What is Tor? - Protects you through
proxy servers, keeps you anonymous.

562
00:40:20,657 --> 00:40:23,118
Then I'll show how to get
to the posting boards and the IRCs.

563
00:40:23,118 --> 00:40:28,874
But I gotta warn you, be careful
what you click. Some crazy shit there, man.

564
00:40:28,874 --> 00:40:32,878
For too long,
we've danced on eggshells

565
00:40:32,878 --> 00:40:35,881
regarding the issue
of cyberwarfare.

566
00:40:35,881 --> 00:40:42,304
<i>Secretary Durant acted on instructions</i>
<i>that came directly from me.</i>

567
00:40:42,304 --> 00:40:45,390
<i>Now, if the Chinese are not willing
to engage in a meaningful dialogue</i>

568
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,976
<i>about intellectual property</i>
<i>of American corporations,</i>

569
00:40:47,976 --> 00:40:52,522
<i>as well as this deliberate targeting of
our government's online infrastructure,</i>

570
00:40:52,522 --> 00:40:55,275
<i>well, then that is proof</i>
<i>of a double-standard mentality</i>

571
00:40:55,275 --> 00:40:57,402
<i>that we shall</i>
<i>no longer tolerate.</i>

572
00:40:57,402 --> 00:41:01,281
<i>Our delegation to the Joint Commission</i>
<i>on Commerce and Trade</i>

573
00:41:01,281 --> 00:41:04,701
<i>was unfairly accused and defamed</i>

574
00:41:04,701 --> 00:41:08,705
<i>by representatives of the</i>
<i>United States government.</i>

575
00:41:08,705 --> 00:41:10,665
<i>The People's Republic of China</i>

576
00:41:10,665 --> 00:41:16,129
<i>will not be threatened by
derisive and unsubstantiated claims.</i>

577
00:41:16,129 --> 00:41:20,258
<i>As long as the White House</i>
<i>continues to behave this way,</i>

578
00:41:20,258 --> 00:41:25,305
<i>any future bilateral trade</i>
<i>talks will be impossible.</i>

579
00:41:25,305 --> 00:41:27,224
It caught me by surprise, too.

580
00:41:27,224 --> 00:41:30,268
Did you say anything to him
after I hung up yesterday?

581
00:41:30,268 --> 00:41:33,522
- No. Have you spoken to him?
- <i> A few minutes ago.</i>

582
00:41:33,522 --> 00:41:35,816
He said he did
what he thought was right.

583
00:41:35,816 --> 00:41:38,068
<i>Well, there's nothing</i>
<i>we can do to combat that.</i>

584
00:41:38,068 --> 00:41:42,114
He doesn't usually go against
my advice without giving me fair warning.

585
00:41:42,114 --> 00:41:47,077
- What are you suggesting, Raymond?
- He's easily manipulated.

586
00:41:47,077 --> 00:41:49,913
- Clearly, not in this case.
- <i> We need to fix this.</i>

587
00:41:49,913 --> 00:41:53,417
<i>- And I'm counting on you for that, Frank.</i>
- Let me freshen your memory.

588
00:41:53,417 --> 00:41:57,713
<i>I don't owe you any favors.</i>
<i>I promised to work with you, not for you.</i>

589
00:41:57,713 --> 00:42:00,006
And when it comes to China,
we both want the same thing.

590
00:42:00,006 --> 00:42:03,510
- So we need to work together.
<i>- To convince Garrett he should retract.</i>

591
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,762
To support the president
in the path that he's chosen.

592
00:42:05,762 --> 00:42:08,515
While he continues
to antagonize them publicly.

593
00:42:08,515 --> 00:42:11,435
While he continues to benefit
from a bump in approval ratings.

594
00:42:11,435 --> 00:42:15,939
<i>A tough stance on China is popular,
and we can use that to our advantage.</i>

595
00:42:15,939 --> 00:42:19,026
<i>Let's just be patient and see if we can
smooth things over from back channels.</i>

596
00:42:19,026 --> 00:42:21,903
If I don't see any results,
you won't have my patience for long.

597
00:42:21,903 --> 00:42:26,742
- That's understood.
- Let me know what Durant has to say.

598
00:42:26,742 --> 00:42:30,078
- Absolutely.
- Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

599
00:42:33,248 --> 00:42:37,294
I thought he might balk
at taking a handout from me.

600
00:42:37,294 --> 00:42:39,171
I'd call it more than a handout.

601
00:42:39,171 --> 00:42:44,092
Well, he's always been the sort of man
who could be bought,

602
00:42:44,092 --> 00:42:46,470
but never cheaply.

603
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:50,265
It's not the chairmanship
that bought him, Ted.

604
00:42:50,265 --> 00:42:52,309
What do you mean?

605
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:55,645
I'm telling you this so that
you have time to call your wife

606
00:42:55,645 --> 00:42:57,814
and prepare your statement.

607
00:43:05,197 --> 00:43:08,325
What's my out?
What's he want from me?

608
00:43:08,325 --> 00:43:11,078
There is no out.
He wants it to hurt.

609
00:43:13,413 --> 00:43:15,415
- You told him?
- I just promised him

610
00:43:15,415 --> 00:43:19,002
- that I could make it happen.
- You can't do this, Jackie.

611
00:43:19,002 --> 00:43:22,047
The story's breaking tomorrow.

612
00:43:22,047 --> 00:43:25,967
- What part of it?
- No names. Just that you have a daughter.

613
00:43:25,967 --> 00:43:29,513
Have you thought about
what this will do to Diane?

614
00:43:29,513 --> 00:43:33,600
- To our sons?
- I hate myself for it.

615
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,853
- But I'll get over that.
- What about her?

616
00:43:36,853 --> 00:43:41,024
- Emily? You can't even say
her name, can you? - Don't lecture me.

617
00:43:41,024 --> 00:43:42,609
You've never been
in the same room with her.

618
00:43:42,609 --> 00:43:45,028
She's had the best
treatment available.

619
00:43:45,028 --> 00:43:47,114
Alone. Hooked up
to machines.

620
00:43:47,114 --> 00:43:49,616
Surrounded by nurses
who punch out at dinnertime.

621
00:43:49,616 --> 00:43:52,452
- You don't know what I've been through.
- You? What about her?

622
00:43:52,452 --> 00:43:56,623
- I can't do more than I've done.
- That's bullshit, Ted.

623
00:43:56,623 --> 00:43:59,209
- You could've found a way.
- I won't defend myself to you.

624
00:43:59,209 --> 00:44:01,920
Don't. Save that
for your wife.

625
00:44:06,216 --> 00:44:09,469
This isn't to punish you, Ted.
It's simpler than that.

626
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:11,513
When I first encouraged
you to run for office,

627
00:44:11,513 --> 00:44:15,434
it's because I sensed
how unstoppable you were.

628
00:44:15,434 --> 00:44:21,189
But I never thought I'd have
to lie down on the tracks myself.

629
00:44:22,524 --> 00:44:26,069
If you're going to put
my neck in the noose,

630
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:30,282
look me in the eye
while you do it.

631
00:44:38,582 --> 00:44:42,127
I'm very grateful
for all that you've done for me.

632
00:44:42,127 --> 00:44:45,047
You'll make an excellent
whip, Jacqueline.

633
00:44:45,047 --> 00:44:48,133
Now, please
get out of my office.

634
00:45:03,523 --> 00:45:05,859
What are you doing?

635
00:45:07,027 --> 00:45:09,363
Sh, sh, sh, sh!

636
00:45:16,745 --> 00:45:20,332
It's finally quiet.

637
00:45:22,918 --> 00:45:26,797
It is, isn't it?

638
00:45:26,797 --> 00:45:30,592
We have our fortress now.

639
00:45:30,592 --> 00:45:33,887
- Where are you coming from?
- My new office.

640
00:45:33,887 --> 00:45:36,431
You just finished
setting it up today.

641
00:45:36,431 --> 00:45:40,310
- Do you like it?
- It's an office. It's fine.
