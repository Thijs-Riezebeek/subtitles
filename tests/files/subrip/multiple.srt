1
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,517
Hey, Pop.

2
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,355
Been a while, hasn't it?

3
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,649
Did you see that motorcade roll up?

4
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:09,071
It's the first time that
the President of the United States

5
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:11,323
has visited Gaffney.

6
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:13,492
Can you believe it?

7
00:02:14,493 --> 00:02:16,454
Oh, I wouldn't be here
if I had a choice.

8
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:18,372
But I have to do these
sort of things now.

9
00:02:18,456 --> 00:02:19,999
Makes me seem more human.

10
00:02:20,082 --> 00:02:23,294
And you have to be a little human
when you're the president.

11
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,880
He couldn't even afford
to pay for his own gravestone.

12
00:02:25,963 --> 00:02:30,426
I paid for it out of my own
scholarship money from The Sentinel.

13
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:33,429
Nobody showed up
for his funeral except me.

14
00:02:33,512 --> 00:02:35,514
Not even my mother.

15
00:02:39,477 --> 00:02:41,729
But I'll tell you this, though, Pop:

16
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:45,691
when they bury me,
it won't be in my backyard.

17
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:49,028
And when they come
to pay their respects,

18
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:51,530
they'll have to wait in line.

19
00:02:57,036 --> 00:02:59,163
You should let us
take a photo at the grave.

20
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:03,167
He wants privacy. The man's
honoring his father, for God's sakes.

22
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:57,531
Here's the info
you were looking for.

23
00:04:57,615 --> 00:05:03,287
And we have that scheduled
for next Tuesday at 10 a.m.

24
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,081
That's still good for you, right?

25
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:08,584
Excellent. I'll confirm it.

26
00:05:12,296 --> 00:05:13,756
Excuse me.

27
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,132
Yes, sir?

28
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:16,717
Yes, sir.

29
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,802
The president is ready to see you now.

30
00:05:22,932 --> 00:05:23,933
Jesus.

31
00:05:25,976 --> 00:05:27,686
I'm devastated.

32
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:31,440
I love this man as if he were my son.

33
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:37,363
Now, he's a fighter,
and I'm sure that he'll pull through.

34
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:39,281
Our prayers are with him.

35
00:05:39,365 --> 00:05:43,243
"...said President Underwood
during a press conference yesterday.

36
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:48,332
The Maryland State Police and
Federal authorities have yet to locate

37
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,627
Mr. Stamper's car or name any suspects."

38
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:56,298
You want more of this, brother?

39
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:00,886
Or maybe the sports page?

40
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:12,398
"Game Six of the World Series
went scoreless for 13 innings

41
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:16,318
before a rain delay that turned
an already epic evening

42
00:06:16,402 --> 00:06:18,612
into one for the history books."

43
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,736
We need a doctor
in room three-one.

44
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,320
Douglas?

45
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:03,157
Can you hear me?

46
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:06,660
I want you to blink if you can hear me.

47
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,375
Again.

48
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,299
My name is Dr. Lanjwani.

49
00:07:20,382 --> 00:07:23,093
The president's office asked me
to look after you personally.

50
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:25,721
You're getting the very best
of care, okay?
