1
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,517
Hey, Pop.

2
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,355
Been a while, hasn't it?

3
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,649
Did you see that motorcade roll up?

4
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:09,071
It's the first time that
the President of the United States

5
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:11,323
has visited Gaffney.

6
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:13,492
Can you believe it?

7
00:02:14,493 --> 00:02:16,454
Oh, I wouldn't be here
if I had a choice.

8
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:18,372
But I have to do these
sort of things now.

9
00:02:18,456 --> 00:02:19,999
Makes me seem more human.

10
00:02:20,082 --> 00:02:23,294
And you have to be a little human
when you're the president.

11
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,880
He couldn't even afford
to pay for his own gravestone.

12
00:02:25,963 --> 00:02:30,426
I paid for it out of my own
scholarship money from The Sentinel.

13
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:33,429
Nobody showed up
for his funeral except me.

14
00:02:33,512 --> 00:02:35,514
Not even my mother.

15
00:02:39,477 --> 00:02:41,729
But I'll tell you this, though, Pop:

16
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:45,691
when they bury me,
it won't be in my backyard.

17
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:49,028
And when they come
to pay their respects,

18
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:51,530
they'll have to wait in line.

19
00:02:57,036 --> 00:02:59,163
You should let us
take a photo at the grave.

20
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:03,167
He wants privacy. The man's
honoring his father, for God's sakes.

21
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:44,854
<font color="#00ffff">Synced and corrected by TVfreak83</font>

22
00:04:54,904 --> 00:04:57,531
Here's the info
you were looking for.

23
00:04:57,615 --> 00:05:03,287
And we have that scheduled
for next Tuesday at 10 a.m.

24
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,081
That's still good for you, right?

25
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:08,584
Excellent. I'll confirm it.

26
00:05:12,296 --> 00:05:13,756
Excuse me.

27
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,132
Yes, sir?

28
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:16,717
Yes, sir.

29
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,802
The president is ready to see you now.

30
00:05:22,932 --> 00:05:23,933
Jesus.

31
00:05:25,976 --> 00:05:27,686
I'm devastated.

32
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:31,440
I love this man as if he were my son.

33
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:37,363
Now, he's a fighter,
and I'm sure that he'll pull through.

34
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:39,281
Our prayers are with him.

35
00:05:39,365 --> 00:05:43,243
"...said President Underwood
during a press conference yesterday.

36
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:48,332
The Maryland State Police and
Federal authorities have yet to locate

37
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,627
Mr. Stamper's car or name any suspects."

38
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:56,298
You want more of this, brother?

39
00:05:58,884 --> 00:06:00,886
Or maybe the sports page?

40
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:12,398
"Game Six of the World Series
went scoreless for 13 innings

41
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:16,318
before a rain delay that turned
an already epic evening

42
00:06:16,402 --> 00:06:18,612
into one for the history books."

43
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,736
We need a doctor
in room three-one.

44
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,320
Douglas?

45
00:07:01,196 --> 00:07:03,157
Can you hear me?

46
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:06,660
I want you to blink if you can hear me.

47
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,375
Again.

48
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,299
My name is Dr. Lanjwani.

49
00:07:20,382 --> 00:07:23,093
The president's office asked me
to look after you personally.

50
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:25,721
You're getting the very best
of care, okay?

51
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:30,642
Douglas, I want you to blink
if you can feel this.

52
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:37,358
Good. Good.

53
00:07:37,441 --> 00:07:39,193
How about this?

54
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,404
Okay. Excellent.

55
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,698
And this?

56
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:50,954
How about here?

57
00:07:55,334 --> 00:07:56,752
Relax.

58
00:07:56,835 --> 00:08:00,255
Relax.
Perfectly normal at this early stage.

59
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:01,590
Relax.

60
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:03,509
That's good.

61
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:05,928
Okay. Get some rest.

62
00:08:32,204 --> 00:08:33,872
Are you gonna hurt me?

63
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:37,501
I will do whatever you want,
please just don't hurt me.

64
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,837
- Does that hurt?
- A little.

65
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,631
All right, let's go ahead.
Try and make a fist for me.

66
00:08:42,714 --> 00:08:44,383
- Remy.
- What's that?

67
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:47,386
Remy Danton. Was he here?

68
00:08:47,469 --> 00:08:49,680
He was.
Just checking on your progress.

69
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:52,224
Go ahead, make that fist for me.

70
00:09:00,232 --> 00:09:04,111
Oh...

71
00:09:04,194 --> 00:09:05,696
- Lion.
- Mm-hm.

72
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,781
Rhinoceros.

73
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:09,575
- Camel.
- Good.

74
00:09:09,658 --> 00:09:11,410
What color is Rudolph's nose?

75
00:09:14,663 --> 00:09:17,249
- Rudolph?
- Reindeer.

76
00:09:19,168 --> 00:09:20,669
Red.

77
00:09:23,046 --> 00:09:24,590
It's red.

78
00:09:24,673 --> 00:09:26,925
The President of the United States?

79
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,097
Douglas?

80
00:09:32,181 --> 00:09:34,600
Who is the President
of the United States?

81
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,689
Frank Underwood.

82
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:43,901
- What year are we in?
- 2014.

83
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,819
What month is it?

84
00:09:48,197 --> 00:09:50,032
It's December.

85
00:09:58,207 --> 00:10:00,167
I have to get back to work.

86
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,004
Douglas. Listen to me.

87
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:07,883
- You suffered a compound fracture--
- I know what I fucking suffered!

88
00:10:08,717 --> 00:10:10,677
I need you to hear me this time.

89
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:15,182
There was damage
to your left frontal cortex.

90
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:20,521
Your motor skills will be a struggle.
Your emotions will be unpredictable.

91
00:10:20,604 --> 00:10:23,607
There's a long road ahead,
and we can't rush it.

92
00:10:26,485 --> 00:10:28,487
- Let's do the test later.
- No.

93
00:10:30,405 --> 00:10:32,157
We'll finish it now.

94
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:35,994
What was your mother's name?

95
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:38,664
She was young and beautiful.

96
00:10:38,747 --> 00:10:42,709
Jacob fell in love with her
while she was watering a lamb, and...

97
00:10:42,793 --> 00:10:45,879
she became his wife
after he worked seven years

98
00:10:45,963 --> 00:10:48,173
to earn her hand in marriage.

99
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:54,137
Push back.
Heel into my hand.

100
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:58,183
Breathe.

101
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:00,644
Back up. Deep breath.
Ready?

102
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:06,149
Push. Push.

103
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:08,694
Hey, Doug.

104
00:11:08,777 --> 00:11:10,320
Focus.

105
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:14,032
The report I submit to Congress today

106
00:11:14,116 --> 00:11:17,953
includes evidence that would normally
warrant criminal prosecution,

107
00:11:18,036 --> 00:11:20,539
but the Justice Department
won't pursue charges

108
00:11:20,622 --> 00:11:23,417
in accordance
with the presidential pardons.

109
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,461
I'm grateful for the hard work
Ms. Dunbar and her team

110
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:29,214
have dedicated to their investigation.

111
00:11:29,298 --> 00:11:32,217
In response, I'll be forming
a bipartisan commission to examine

112
00:11:32,301 --> 00:11:35,762
campaign finance reform
so history does not repeat itself,

113
00:11:35,846 --> 00:11:38,557
and so that our nation can heal
from these wounds.

114
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,726
I got bacon-cheese and regular.
Which one you want?

115
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:42,019
Just a minute.

116
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:47,107
Remember when you'd never eat a burger
if it didn't have bacon on it?

117
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,194
Dad would get so pissed because he hated
the smell of bacon grease on the grill.

118
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:52,696
I'm trying to listen, Gary.

119
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:55,949
The president's hands
are tied. Might as well let him burn.

120
00:11:56,033 --> 00:11:58,160
They're getting their
marshmallows ready.

121
00:11:58,243 --> 00:12:00,329
Look at Underwood's approval rating.

122
00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:02,372
It's worse than Walker's
before he resigned.

123
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:04,750
That's a deep, deep hole
to climb out of.

124
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,752
The Republicans are gonna
have their fun for a while.

125
00:12:06,835 --> 00:12:10,005
Plenty to hammer him on
in the general. And they're out for blood.

126
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:12,132
They lost big on education
and entitlement reform.

127
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:14,843
And if the rumors
about America Works are true...

128
00:12:14,926 --> 00:12:16,845
For the left,
that's just too far to the right

129
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:18,555
and for the right,
it's too far to the left.

130
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:20,891
They need me back.

131
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:22,768
Where? The White House?

132
00:12:22,851 --> 00:12:25,729
We got to turn the corner,
start ramping up for 2016.

133
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,105
He might turn this around.

134
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:29,107
You don't really think
he's gonna win, do you?

135
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:30,859
The guy's experienced.
Underwood has a lot...

136
00:12:30,942 --> 00:12:32,611
He'll recover.

137
00:12:32,694 --> 00:12:35,197
He's a behind-the-scenes guy.
He's not comfortable in the spotlight.

138
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,284
- How about you recover first?
- ...glad-handing and kissing babies.

139
00:12:39,368 --> 00:12:42,329
This is gonna be a long 18 months
if this proves any indication.

140
00:12:42,412 --> 00:12:45,749
It can be a lot of chest-thumping
but nothing really getting done.

141
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:49,252
The Xybenetrin
will help with depression.

142
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,922
The buspirone is for anxiety.
Here you go.

143
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:58,887
I'd like to prescribe you something
for the pain, but with your...

144
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,264
Well, any patient with a history
of addictive behavior--

145
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:04,184
I know. It's fine.

146
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:05,852
I can handle the pain.

147
00:13:37,843 --> 00:13:39,553
He looks a lot better.

148
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:42,806
No, he's still asleep.

149
00:13:45,434 --> 00:13:46,935
I have to go.

150
00:13:47,018 --> 00:13:48,186
Okay.

151
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:51,398
Is this a bad time?

152
00:13:53,024 --> 00:13:54,526
No. It's fine.

153
00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:56,820
No, it's just no one told me
you were coming.

154
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:01,199
Hi. Francis sends his love.

155
00:14:01,283 --> 00:14:03,452
He would visit himself,
but with the media...

156
00:14:03,535 --> 00:14:05,412
No, I understand.

157
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:08,457
He did come before, when...

158
00:14:09,332 --> 00:14:10,834
- Both of us.
- I know.

159
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,711
I saw the flowers.
Thank you.

160
00:14:12,794 --> 00:14:14,588
- You look well.
- I'm getting there.

161
00:14:14,671 --> 00:14:16,756
I just want to get better
so I can get back to work.

162
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,217
We're looking forward to that.

163
00:14:19,885 --> 00:14:22,387
We can use all the help
we can get, actually.

164
00:14:22,471 --> 00:14:24,014
Yeah. Been watching the news.

165
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:27,350
Francis, he's at his wit's end.
The Republicans...

166
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:30,228
won't send him a single bill
he can sign.

167
00:14:30,312 --> 00:14:33,023
- And the Democrats aren't much better.
- Bob Birch?

168
00:14:33,106 --> 00:14:35,859
Blind leading the stupid.

169
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:39,404
How's Remy working out?

170
00:14:39,488 --> 00:14:43,742
Well, we'd much rather have you there,
but he's doing a fine job.

171
00:14:45,577 --> 00:14:48,997
Doug, do you... recall anything?

172
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,166
- About what happened?
- Why?

173
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:52,542
Did the police find something?

174
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:55,712
Not that we're aware of. And we've
asked them to hold off questioning you

175
00:14:55,796 --> 00:14:57,923
until you're feeling more like yourself.

176
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:04,387
Rachel, she...

177
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:11,353
I don't remember.

178
00:15:12,229 --> 00:15:14,397
Yes, you do.

179
00:15:19,027 --> 00:15:21,446
A carjacking.

180
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,740
- A man.
- What sort of man?

181
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:25,784
That part's fuzzy.

182
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:27,744
It could be anyone, then.
Any man.

183
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:30,080
Yeah. Any man.

184
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:33,416
- And he got frightened?
- I chased him and that's all.

185
00:15:36,086 --> 00:15:40,048
- Any idea where she is?
- No.

186
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:42,926
Because it's important that we find her.

187
00:15:45,095 --> 00:15:46,429
I really don't know.

188
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:49,182
That's the truth.

189
00:15:53,144 --> 00:15:56,648
I want you to tell all of this
to the police, exactly what you told me,

190
00:15:56,731 --> 00:15:59,442
about the carjacking and the man.
Nothing about her.

191
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,236
I got it.

192
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:04,573
If you need anything,
or remember anything...

193
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:11,162
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.

194
00:16:35,145 --> 00:16:37,647
That's good. One more time.
Up and forward. That's good.

195
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:39,482
Excellent. Breathe.

196
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,026
Good.

197
00:16:41,109 --> 00:16:42,611
Good. Good.

198
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:46,323
Okay.

199
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:49,618
Let's try this one.
You're doing a great job.

200
00:16:51,119 --> 00:16:53,121
Keep breathing. Good.

201
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:55,749
Good job, Doug.

202
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:00,837
Okay. Moving forward.
You got it.

203
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:02,297
Great. Great job.

204
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,715
Keep going.

205
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:06,009
Good. Breathe.

206
00:17:08,178 --> 00:17:09,888
Excellent. Good.

207
00:17:09,971 --> 00:17:12,015
One more.

208
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,558
Great job.

209
00:17:13,642 --> 00:17:15,435
One more time.
It's almost done. Ready?

210
00:17:15,518 --> 00:17:16,853
Keep breathing.

211
00:17:16,937 --> 00:17:19,397
Just his voice.
He said, "Get out of the car."

212
00:17:19,481 --> 00:17:21,358
Anything you can say about the voice?

213
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:24,945
Was it, uh...
Accent? Lisp? High? Low?

214
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:26,696
Deep.

215
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:28,615
That's all I remember.

216
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:32,786
Then I laid on the horn. I...

217
00:17:34,537 --> 00:17:36,623
I remember him running.

218
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:38,792
Like a blur, I got out.

219
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:41,419
I chased him.

220
00:17:44,255 --> 00:17:45,882
I'm not sure. I must have...

221
00:17:46,883 --> 00:17:49,094
What were you doing
in that part of Maryland?

222
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:54,891
Mr. Stamper?

223
00:17:54,975 --> 00:17:58,186
Sir. What were you doing
in that part of Maryland?

224
00:18:01,064 --> 00:18:03,108
I drive sometimes to think.

225
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:06,236
There was a lot on my mind with work.
I drive to clear my head.

226
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:10,824
Have you found the car?

227
00:18:11,741 --> 00:18:14,327
We don't have anything
other than what you just told us.

228
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:20,959
How's your mood been?
Any episodes?

229
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:22,252
No. The meds are working.

230
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,795
You just telling me what I want to hear?

231
00:18:23,878 --> 00:18:26,715
No. I feel good.

232
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:28,008
Okay.

233
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:30,844
I'm gonna sign your release today.

234
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:34,014
But it's important
you take it easy at first.

235
00:18:34,097 --> 00:18:36,266
Everything's gonna be
much harder in general.

236
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:37,475
I know.

237
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,102
Do you have someone
who can look after you?

238
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,563
Yeah. My brother Gary's in from Ohio.

239
00:18:41,646 --> 00:18:43,481
Good. How long is he here for?

240
00:18:43,565 --> 00:18:46,735
- A while, I guess.
- Okay, great.

241
00:18:46,818 --> 00:18:50,780
It's important you go to your meetings.
Stay on top of your sobriety.

242
00:18:52,449 --> 00:18:55,910
Take this.
It's for the steroids I prescribed you.

243
00:18:55,994 --> 00:19:00,457
It's one shot into the right thigh,
once a week. The nurse, she...

244
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,916
- She showed me how.
- Okay.

245
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:24,564
You do this?

246
00:19:24,647 --> 00:19:26,357
No, it wasn't me.

247
00:19:55,303 --> 00:19:56,638
I talked to my boss.

248
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:59,808
I can stick around
for another couple of weeks

249
00:19:59,891 --> 00:20:02,644
- while you transition back.
- You should get back to your family.

250
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:04,270
Nah... Sarah's fine with it.

251
00:20:04,354 --> 00:20:05,814
The kids are, too.

252
00:20:05,897 --> 00:20:08,942
Gary, we've hardly spoken in ten years.

253
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:11,528
You've already gone above and beyond.

254
00:20:12,153 --> 00:20:15,573
All right.
You want me to go?

255
00:20:16,574 --> 00:20:17,575
I'm fine.

256
00:20:18,576 --> 00:20:20,829
Thanks for everything.

257
00:20:20,912 --> 00:20:22,205
Okay.

258
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:25,583
I mean, I'm just a phone call
and a plane ticket away.

259
00:20:32,674 --> 00:20:34,259
Safe travels.

260
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:37,387
Uh...

261
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,805
Take care.

262
00:20:43,768 --> 00:20:45,728
Hey, Gary, I...

263
00:20:48,565 --> 00:20:50,108
Send me some pictures of the kids.

264
00:20:52,902 --> 00:20:54,404
Yeah, I will.

265
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,253
But one of the things I admire
about you is that in Washington, DC,

266
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:12,881
which is so gridlocked,
you get things done.

267
00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:15,884
And I understand you've got, um,
a new piece of legislation,

268
00:21:15,967 --> 00:21:18,678
a major new initiative
you're rolling out. What is it?

269
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:22,265
That is correct. It's a new jobs program
that we're calling America Works.

270
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:26,060
Oh. So it's a fantasy novel.

271
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,104
This is
a fundamentally different look

272
00:21:28,188 --> 00:21:30,523
at how to solve
the problem of unemployment.

273
00:21:30,607 --> 00:21:33,526
It has the size
and the scope of the New Deal.

274
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,863
Oh. So it's a socialist
redistribution of wealth

275
00:21:36,946 --> 00:21:39,532
wherein the baby boomers
will latch onto the millennials

276
00:21:39,616 --> 00:21:43,369
like a lamprey and just keep sucking
until they're as dry as a crouton?

277
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,749
This is about
putting people to work

278
00:21:47,832 --> 00:21:50,084
and avoiding the entitlements entirely.

279
00:21:50,168 --> 00:21:51,586
Well, I like the sound of that.

280
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:53,630
So what, we're gonna
privatize Social Security

281
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:56,633
and then raise revenue
by hunting the elderly for sport?

282
00:21:58,092 --> 00:22:00,094
- Good plan. Use that.
- No, as I said,

283
00:22:00,178 --> 00:22:02,388
this is a fundamentally
different approach entirely.

284
00:22:02,472 --> 00:22:05,642
And you think that the Republicans
in Congress will cooperate with you?

285
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:09,812
Oh, I think that it has been proved
that both parties want the same thing.

286
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:12,774
A new president in 2016?

287
00:22:12,857 --> 00:22:17,028
No. No, I think actually,
I think unemployment, eradicating it,

288
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:19,656
and I think a strong economy
is something both parties want.

289
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:22,992
Okay, speaking of everyone,
there's a recent poll by Reuters.

290
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:25,620
I wanna get this right.
It says that eight out of ten Americans

291
00:22:25,703 --> 00:22:29,332
agree that you lack, quote,
"effectiveness and leadership."

292
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:32,210
Uh, look,
I don't let polls like that bother me.

293
00:22:32,293 --> 00:22:35,421
I think that once the nation
sees AmWorks in action,

294
00:22:35,505 --> 00:22:38,925
- they will change their attitudes.
- I'm sorry, "AmWorks?"

295
00:22:39,008 --> 00:22:40,969
I'm sorry-- I didn't realize
it was called AmWorks.

296
00:22:41,052 --> 00:22:43,721
Is that like Amway?
Is it a pyramid scheme?

297
00:22:43,805 --> 00:22:45,932
Is that what you're selling
the American people?

298
00:22:46,015 --> 00:22:49,018
No, it's actually just an abbreviation
to make it easier to say.

299
00:22:49,102 --> 00:22:53,022
Well, if you make it small enough,
uh, maybe it'll be easier to swallow.

300
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:59,070
You know, even though
you're a Democrat, I respect you.

301
00:22:59,153 --> 00:23:01,781
But let's just take a look
at the facts here for a second.

302
00:23:01,864 --> 00:23:05,785
You've been president for six months,
and again, I wanna get this right,

303
00:23:05,868 --> 00:23:09,205
unemployment has gone up, our trade
deficit with China has increased,

304
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:11,290
the number of vetoes has skyrocketed.

305
00:23:11,374 --> 00:23:13,960
I'm not entirely sure that I'm confident

306
00:23:14,043 --> 00:23:17,463
that you'll be able to eradicate
unemployment the same way

307
00:23:17,547 --> 00:23:20,133
you've been able
to eradicate your approval polls.

308
00:23:20,216 --> 00:23:22,301
What, you know, what do you--

309
00:23:22,385 --> 00:23:25,054
How are you going to get it across
to the American people?

310
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:43,322
- Doug?
- Seth?

311
00:23:43,406 --> 00:23:45,575
Yeah, it's me.

312
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:47,744
Mrs. Underwood,
she gave me this phone, but--

313
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:49,620
I know. Is something wrong?

314
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:53,416
No. I want to speak to the president.

315
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,084
Is it urgent?

316
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:57,170
I want to talk to him
about the America Works program.

317
00:23:57,253 --> 00:24:00,006
- So nothing urgent.
- It's not an emergency, no.

318
00:24:00,089 --> 00:24:02,425
'Cause that's what this phone is for.

319
00:24:04,427 --> 00:24:06,054
Will you pass on my message?

320
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:42,006
Ah!

321
00:25:27,885 --> 00:25:29,137
Hey.

322
00:25:32,014 --> 00:25:33,015
You're late.

323
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:35,518
I switched cabs three times.

324
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:38,688
- Were you being followed?
- Didn't want to take chances.

325
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,318
- You know why I asked you here.
- I don't know where she is.

326
00:25:44,402 --> 00:25:47,113
- Then you need to find out.
- I ran her social, her name,

327
00:25:47,196 --> 00:25:48,990
police records, taxes, everything.

328
00:25:49,073 --> 00:25:51,659
She could be tossed in a ditch
by a john for all I know.

329
00:25:51,742 --> 00:25:54,120
- You work at the FBI.
- What do I get in return?

330
00:25:54,203 --> 00:25:56,122
My protection, like you asked.

331
00:25:56,205 --> 00:25:58,708
I thought you had something to offer.
Something real.

332
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:00,126
Like money?

333
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:04,046
Like getting me out of the Bureau. You
make that happen, maybe I can help you.

334
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,216
That was a condition,
for your charges being dropped.

335
00:26:10,678 --> 00:26:12,847
See, you don't still know people.

336
00:26:14,515 --> 00:26:17,643
- I shouldn't have even come here.
- I am your only safety net.

337
00:26:17,727 --> 00:26:20,146
You think I would have turned over
all the AT&T records

338
00:26:20,229 --> 00:26:21,814
without leaving a backup with somebody?

339
00:26:21,898 --> 00:26:24,567
I'm not gonna blow my get-out-of-jail
card on a wild goose chase.

340
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,405
Does anyone suspect anything?

341
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:30,948
At the Bureau?

342
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,827
Nobody has a clue about her.

343
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:37,038
If that gives you any peace of mind.

344
00:26:54,931 --> 00:26:56,057
Doug?

345
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,309
Tell him it's urgent.

346
00:26:58,392 --> 00:27:00,186
We're aiming for sometime in May.

347
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:02,813
As soon as we agree on a date
with the Russian delegation,

348
00:27:02,897 --> 00:27:05,608
you will be the first to know. Uh, Greg.

349
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,360
The Summit with Petrov
here in Washington,

350
00:27:07,443 --> 00:27:09,195
what'll be the focus of the talks?

351
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:11,405
A bilateral approach to the Middle East.

352
00:27:11,489 --> 00:27:13,783
As you know, the Palestinians
have refused to negotiate

353
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:15,910
until Israeli troops
leave the Jordan Valley.

354
00:27:15,993 --> 00:27:18,663
We hope to address
this with President Petrov

355
00:27:18,746 --> 00:27:21,040
so that we can move on
to a whole host of other issues.

356
00:27:21,123 --> 00:27:21,958
Sara.

357
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:24,919
So this bilateral approach doesn't
include Israel and Palestine.

358
00:27:25,002 --> 00:27:27,505
The State Department
is briefing all interested parties.

359
00:27:27,588 --> 00:27:29,840
The summit's really just a first step.
Ayla.

360
00:27:29,924 --> 00:27:32,134
I'd like to change course
to the America Works program.

361
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:33,094
Please.

362
00:27:33,177 --> 00:27:35,429
I've spoken to a number
of the president's policy advisors,

363
00:27:35,513 --> 00:27:38,057
who say there's been a lot
of disagreement on the economic team

364
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,143
as to exactly what form
this jobs package should take.

365
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:43,104
- Which advisors?
- Nice try.

366
00:27:43,187 --> 00:27:47,275
To be clear, this is far more
than just a jobs package.

367
00:27:47,358 --> 00:27:52,071
It is a comprehensive plan, which aims
at full employment within two years.

368
00:27:52,154 --> 00:27:54,532
So as such, there are a lot
of details to be worked out.

369
00:27:54,615 --> 00:27:56,409
So your sources are inaccurate.

370
00:27:56,492 --> 00:27:58,452
It's not so much a disagreement

371
00:27:58,536 --> 00:28:01,414
as it is debating the finer points
of the plan. Jess.

372
00:28:01,497 --> 00:28:03,958
Just to follow up.
What are some of the finer points?

373
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:06,794
Or the broad strokes, even. No one
from the White House has said anything.

374
00:28:06,877 --> 00:28:09,755
When we have a plan to present,
we will present it.

375
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:11,424
Jess?

376
00:28:11,507 --> 00:28:14,927
Is America Works a reaction
to the president's low approval ratings?

377
00:28:15,011 --> 00:28:17,805
An effort to offer some sign of progress
ramping up to the elections?

378
00:28:17,888 --> 00:28:19,640
We've been working on this plan
since day one.

379
00:28:19,724 --> 00:28:21,392
It has nothing to do
with the approval ratings.

380
00:28:21,475 --> 00:28:24,729
But as for the election...
uh, whose turn is it to ask today?

381
00:28:24,812 --> 00:28:28,316
- Mark?
- Is the president running in 2016?

382
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,485
Today, the priority
is good government, but...

383
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:34,071
Ask me again tomorrow.

384
00:28:34,155 --> 00:28:35,906
Thank you, everyone.

385
00:28:37,366 --> 00:28:38,909
We've got a window at ten.

386
00:28:38,993 --> 00:28:40,494
I'll call him now.

387
00:28:44,624 --> 00:28:46,375
Please, sit down.

388
00:28:47,376 --> 00:28:48,794
John. Samantha.

389
00:28:48,878 --> 00:28:51,672
You spoke to a journalist
about disagreements in this room?

390
00:28:51,756 --> 00:28:53,924
If that happens again,
you're off the team.

391
00:28:54,008 --> 00:28:56,385
And speaking of the disagreements
in this room,

392
00:28:56,469 --> 00:28:59,472
we now have an even bigger one,
because Remy has shown me

393
00:28:59,555 --> 00:29:02,516
your work so far and...

394
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,393
it's toothless.

395
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:08,522
I stood in this room three months ago
and gave you all very clear direction.

396
00:29:08,606 --> 00:29:11,359
Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,

397
00:29:11,442 --> 00:29:14,278
every entitlement program
that is sucking us dry,

398
00:29:14,362 --> 00:29:17,573
I want it all on the table.
And this doesn't go nearly far enough.

399
00:29:17,657 --> 00:29:20,201
So we obviously have
to get back to some basics.

400
00:29:20,284 --> 00:29:23,371
Remind ourselves of some of the facts
that are before us--

401
00:29:23,454 --> 00:29:25,581
- Sir, if I may--
- No, no, no, no.

402
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:30,711
I will speak first,
and then you will speak, Paul.

403
00:29:34,131 --> 00:29:36,634
This is what
the average senior citizen gets,

404
00:29:36,717 --> 00:29:38,636
one year from entitlements,

405
00:29:38,719 --> 00:29:41,222
whether they were a janitor
or they ran a hedge fund.

406
00:29:41,305 --> 00:29:45,101
That-- This money is a job

407
00:29:45,184 --> 00:29:48,437
we could be giving to a single mother
or a student just out of school.

408
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:49,897
Now, at the moment,

409
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,318
44 cents of every tax dollar
goes to pay for these programs.

410
00:29:54,402 --> 00:29:57,571
By 2030, it'll be over half, 62 cents.

411
00:29:57,655 --> 00:30:00,408
Entitlements are bankrupting us.

412
00:30:00,491 --> 00:30:02,868
Now, I had Remy conduct a little poll.

413
00:30:02,952 --> 00:30:05,246
"Doing what's best for my country

414
00:30:05,329 --> 00:30:06,914
means doing some things
that I don't like."

415
00:30:06,997 --> 00:30:09,417
Seventy-four percent agreed
with this statement.

416
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,129
Seventy-four percent.
Now, what does that tell us?

417
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:17,341
We have to do the things
that people won't like.

418
00:30:17,425 --> 00:30:21,053
And even when we do, three out of four
of them will go along with us.

419
00:30:21,137 --> 00:30:23,973
And why?
Because we're promising jobs.

420
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:27,059
And again, where are the three areas

421
00:30:27,143 --> 00:30:30,438
that we're gonna be
creating these jobs from?

422
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:33,482
Infrastructure at the state
and federal level.

423
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:35,568
Increasing the size of the military,

424
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:37,987
and working with our friends
in the private sector to start--

425
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,573
I'm sorry, sir,
but I have to interrupt.

426
00:30:40,656 --> 00:30:43,826
The programs that you want
to scale back or dismantle

427
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:46,245
are the bedrock
of the American dream.

428
00:30:46,328 --> 00:30:47,997
You work hard, you pay your taxes--

429
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,000
No, I'm sorry, they were
the bedrock of the American dream.

430
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,668
But they're not anymore.

431
00:30:52,752 --> 00:30:55,796
Certainly not for the ten million people
who are out of work.

432
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,091
But practically speaking,
a thousand special interests,

433
00:30:59,175 --> 00:31:01,719
organized labor,
opposition in both parties.

434
00:31:01,802 --> 00:31:04,722
Now, we can do a version
of what you're proposing--

435
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:07,516
I don't want a version.

436
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,852
I want a vision.

437
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:14,982
As head of this team,
and I think I speak for everyone,

438
00:31:15,065 --> 00:31:17,860
- we have done--
- Speaking as the president,

439
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:20,738
who chose this team
and for whom it works,

440
00:31:20,821 --> 00:31:25,868
I want five hundred billion dollars
to put ten million people to work.

441
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:27,787
I don't care how much it hurts.

442
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:30,247
I don't care how controversial it is.

443
00:31:30,331 --> 00:31:32,958
Your job is to find a way.

444
00:31:33,042 --> 00:31:37,171
It's my job to convince Congress
and the American people.

445
00:31:37,254 --> 00:31:42,218
Your job is not to sell me
on your version of my program.

446
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,846
Now, are we all clear
on what our jobs are?

447
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:50,100
Good, because I want to present this
proposal to leadership in 30 days.

448
00:31:50,184 --> 00:31:52,144
- Let's make it happen.
- Paul?

449
00:31:57,399 --> 00:31:59,902
- Your services are no longer needed.
- Excuse me?

450
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:02,196
Let's keep it quiet,
let's keep it cordial.

451
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:04,907
- Thanks for all your work.
- I'll get my things.

452
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,243
I'll have them sent down
to you in the lobby.

453
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:42,444
Hello?

454
00:32:43,946 --> 00:32:46,073
Yeah. I'm on my way.

455
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:18,355
Ah! Oh!

456
00:33:21,692 --> 00:33:24,320
Ah! God!

457
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:27,907
Ah!

458
00:33:57,978 --> 00:33:59,939
Oh!

459
00:34:03,317 --> 00:34:05,319
Ah!

460
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:10,741
Ah!

461
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:12,910
Mm...

462
00:34:17,957 --> 00:34:20,292
Ahh!

463
00:34:20,376 --> 00:34:23,128
God!

464
00:34:29,677 --> 00:34:32,596
It'll be a few minutes.
Please, have a seat.

465
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:52,533
- How long have you known?
- Two months.

466
00:34:52,616 --> 00:34:55,285
It hasn't impaired my judgment
on the bench.

467
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:59,873
And it's early on. We don't expect
any real symptoms for quite some time.

468
00:34:59,957 --> 00:35:05,921
I won't be wandering around the Supreme
Court in my boxer shorts anytime soon.

469
00:35:06,005 --> 00:35:10,843
But I'd like to retire now,
long before we get there.

470
00:35:10,926 --> 00:35:13,637
Well, Justice, I want to thank you
for having the courage

471
00:35:13,721 --> 00:35:17,850
to come and share this news with me.
Are you sure the diagnosis is correct?

472
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:21,145
My doctor's the same
that treated the vice president's wife.

473
00:35:21,228 --> 00:35:24,106
He's the foremost
Alzheimer's specialist in America.

474
00:35:25,107 --> 00:35:27,234
Yes, I made Donald my vice president.

475
00:35:27,317 --> 00:35:29,987
I'd rather him be a pain in my ass here
than over in Congress.

476
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:33,407
And even the Republicans couldn't
refuse a man who just buried his wife.

477
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,159
Terrible how quickly Marjory went.

478
00:35:35,242 --> 00:35:39,580
I'm telling you this now so you
have time to think about candidates

479
00:35:39,663 --> 00:35:42,249
before I announce my retirement.

480
00:35:42,332 --> 00:35:45,127
- How much time can you give me?
- How much do you need?

481
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,755
I'm about to introduce
America Works to Congress.

482
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:50,507
It's sure to be an uphill battle.
And I'd prefer not to add

483
00:35:50,591 --> 00:35:53,218
a Supreme Court nomination to the mix.

484
00:35:53,302 --> 00:35:55,387
The Republicans will just
use it as leverage.

485
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:58,557
I've heard rumblings.
Entitlements on the chopping block?

486
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,768
All the more reason
to keep you on the bench.

487
00:36:00,851 --> 00:36:03,520
It's sure to be challenged
in the Judiciary.

488
00:36:03,604 --> 00:36:08,275
Mr. President,
I want to spend as much time

489
00:36:08,358 --> 00:36:10,861
with my wife as possible

490
00:36:10,944 --> 00:36:14,782
in the good years that I have left.

491
00:36:14,865 --> 00:36:17,910
When Marjory was ill,
she wanted the same thing.

492
00:36:17,993 --> 00:36:20,788
She left the Smithsonian,
and you know what?

493
00:36:20,871 --> 00:36:24,208
She hated every second of being at home,
of not being productive,

494
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:26,752
of not doing what she loved.

495
00:36:26,835 --> 00:36:30,297
It made her time
with us much harder, and...

496
00:36:31,465 --> 00:36:33,884
it made her deeply unhappy.

497
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:37,346
Work is the best distraction.
I wish she hadn't retired.

498
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:41,391
And, uh...
before she lost her lucid thought,

499
00:36:41,475 --> 00:36:43,227
she said she regretted it, too.

500
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:47,189
Can you give me six months?
A year at the most? That's all.

501
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:49,691
Just enough time
to get this program up and running

502
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:52,361
before I have
to face a Supreme Court fight.

503
00:36:55,072 --> 00:36:57,074
- I need to think it over.
- Oh, of course.

504
00:36:57,157 --> 00:36:59,827
- Speak to your wife.
- I'll walk you out.

505
00:37:04,331 --> 00:37:07,668
- I better get that research center.
- Yes, a deal is a deal.

506
00:37:07,751 --> 00:37:10,379
Now, good God, Donald,
let's get something done.

507
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:16,426
Now you see why Donald said yes.

508
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:20,180
He may hate my guts, but there's
nothing like a death in the family

509
00:37:20,264 --> 00:37:22,474
to separate the wheat from the bullshit.

510
00:37:22,558 --> 00:37:23,559
Send him in.

511
00:37:23,642 --> 00:37:25,352
Yes, sir.

512
00:37:25,435 --> 00:37:27,688
The president is ready to see you now.

513
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:49,626
Doug.

514
00:37:51,295 --> 00:37:52,963
Mr. President.

515
00:37:55,132 --> 00:37:57,885
The doctor told me your recovery
is going very well.

516
00:37:57,968 --> 00:37:59,636
Yeah. Well, there's this.

517
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,763
But everything else is as good as new.

518
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:03,932
It's great to see you.

519
00:38:04,016 --> 00:38:05,893
Claire and I have been
worried sick about you.

520
00:38:05,976 --> 00:38:07,186
Thank you for the gifts.

521
00:38:07,269 --> 00:38:08,812
- Well...
- For looking out for me.

522
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:11,732
I don't have that many close friends.
I count you among them.

523
00:38:12,733 --> 00:38:16,528
- I appreciate your saying that, sir.
- Oh, drop the "sir." We're old pals.

524
00:38:17,613 --> 00:38:19,072
Well...

525
00:38:19,948 --> 00:38:22,576
I'm the one who should apologize.

526
00:38:22,659 --> 00:38:25,871
You gave me another chance.
You trusted me.

527
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,291
And what happened,
I take responsibility for that.

528
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:32,169
- No, for putting you in that position.
- Stop. It's not necessary.

529
00:38:32,252 --> 00:38:34,755
- I endangered you just as--
- Yeah, but all I care about

530
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:37,674
is that you are alive
and getting better.

531
00:38:37,758 --> 00:38:39,801
Let the rest of it go.

532
00:38:41,178 --> 00:38:43,764
- You know how devoted I am.
- You don't have to say it.

533
00:38:43,847 --> 00:38:46,141
You proved it time and time again.

534
00:38:46,225 --> 00:38:47,935
Now, come on, come on, sit down.

535
00:38:49,686 --> 00:38:51,188
Right here.

536
00:39:13,627 --> 00:39:16,338
I should've taken care of her
when I had the chance.

537
00:39:19,341 --> 00:39:20,968
I haven't found her yet.

538
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:25,389
But when I do, I'll make sure
that no one else does.

539
00:39:25,472 --> 00:39:27,432
You can count on that, sir.

540
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:31,144
How is it, uh...?

541
00:39:31,228 --> 00:39:33,272
Probably better
if we don't talk about it.

542
00:39:33,355 --> 00:39:35,107
Right, of course.

543
00:39:37,818 --> 00:39:40,404
Well, they told me you needed to see me.

544
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:46,201
Well, sir, I...
I know that it's a lot to ask,

545
00:39:46,285 --> 00:39:49,705
and that I probably don't deserve it,
considering the mess I put us in.

546
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:52,624
And I'm sure you have your doubts.

547
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:55,085
I realize it couldn't
be anything too visible, but...

548
00:39:55,168 --> 00:39:57,045
I've been following everything
with America Works.

549
00:39:57,129 --> 00:40:00,757
- Oh. Well, that's a ways off.
- But I was thinking that I could help.

550
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:04,720
There should be a targeted plan
for lobbying committee leadership.

551
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:06,388
And I can work with the political team,

552
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:08,682
coordinate with House leg directors,
chiefs of staff--

553
00:40:08,765 --> 00:40:12,269
I was in Gaffney yesterday,
visiting my father's grave.

554
00:40:13,145 --> 00:40:15,063
He never took care of himself.

555
00:40:15,147 --> 00:40:19,693
He ignored his heart problems
and... he paid the price.

556
00:40:21,445 --> 00:40:24,448
You have to respect
your own mortality, Doug.

557
00:40:24,531 --> 00:40:26,825
I don't want to be standing
over your grave.

558
00:40:26,908 --> 00:40:28,952
Now, look...

559
00:40:29,036 --> 00:40:33,332
There is a place
for you here, I promise.

560
00:40:33,415 --> 00:40:35,500
But we have to go about this slowly.

561
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:38,545
I'll work from home.
Only direct contact with you or Remy.

562
00:40:38,628 --> 00:40:40,380
You know the way
that you can help me the best

563
00:40:40,464 --> 00:40:42,341
is to do exactly
what you're doing right now,

564
00:40:42,424 --> 00:40:44,176
focusing on your recovery.

565
00:40:44,259 --> 00:40:48,722
I would never forgive myself if I
put too much on your plate too soon.

566
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:53,643
You're right.

567
00:40:55,437 --> 00:40:57,105
I'm sorry.

568
00:41:04,404 --> 00:41:05,405
Thank you.

569
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:07,115
I'm sorry, I have to go.

570
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,951
But look, I meant what I said.

571
00:41:10,035 --> 00:41:12,621
When you are truly ready.

572
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,081
Yes, sir.

573
00:41:14,998 --> 00:41:16,792
Stay as long as you like.

574
00:41:35,477 --> 00:41:39,648
Three hours ago, we pinpointed him here,
in the Shabwa region of Yemen.

575
00:41:40,482 --> 00:41:41,441
Cooperation?

576
00:41:41,525 --> 00:41:43,735
I spoke to the foreign minister
a few minutes ago.

577
00:41:43,819 --> 00:41:45,904
- Civilians?
- Two dozen, non-IDs.

578
00:41:45,987 --> 00:41:47,614
That's too many.

579
00:41:47,697 --> 00:41:50,575
Our concern is that he could
be on the move at any moment.

580
00:41:50,659 --> 00:41:52,619
Sir, with Petrov
coming to Washington--

581
00:41:52,702 --> 00:41:55,038
It's taken us two years
to track Abdullah down.

582
00:41:55,122 --> 00:41:57,707
We can't ignore every opportunity
between now and the summit.

583
00:41:59,376 --> 00:42:00,836
Do you have eyes on the village?

584
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:04,381
Yes, sir. He's in this building here.

585
00:42:04,464 --> 00:42:07,092
Kill zone is anyone within 50 meters.

586
00:42:09,344 --> 00:42:12,556
If we take him out with no civilian
casualties, I'll authorize the strike.

587
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:14,307
Sir, if I may, I really think--

588
00:42:14,391 --> 00:42:18,228
President Petrov is coming
to Washington in less than two months.

589
00:42:18,311 --> 00:42:21,314
Our entire Middle East policy
hinges on that meeting.

590
00:42:21,398 --> 00:42:24,734
We don't want to give
the Muslim community any viable reasons

591
00:42:24,818 --> 00:42:27,487
to obstruct things if we can avoid it.

592
00:42:27,571 --> 00:42:29,489
So find a way to do this
without killing civilians.

593
00:42:29,573 --> 00:42:30,615
Thank you all very much.

594
00:42:30,699 --> 00:42:34,619
May I have a moment?
It's about Claire.

595
00:42:34,703 --> 00:42:38,373
If your husband nominates you,
I can't pull any punches.

596
00:42:38,457 --> 00:42:40,917
Lack of experience. Nepotism.

597
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:42,544
That's right.

598
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:47,632
- And you think I'm a dilettante.
- No. But plenty of people will.

599
00:42:47,716 --> 00:42:49,843
I've been preparing
since Francis took office.

600
00:42:49,926 --> 00:42:53,680
What I lack in experience
I'll make up for in work ethic.

601
00:42:53,763 --> 00:42:55,432
Why Ambassador to the UN?

602
00:42:55,515 --> 00:42:57,726
You wield far more influence
as the First Lady.

603
00:42:57,809 --> 00:43:00,562
That's not the same
as contributing in a concrete way.

604
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:03,148
If we vote down your confirmation,

605
00:43:03,231 --> 00:43:07,777
are you comfortable
with that sort of public embarrassment?

606
00:43:07,861 --> 00:43:09,362
I know that's a risk.

607
00:43:11,656 --> 00:43:15,118
- You're running in 2016, right?
- No comment.

608
00:43:15,202 --> 00:43:17,579
Francis and I are impressed

609
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:20,499
by how the Republicans
are consolidating around you.

610
00:43:20,582 --> 00:43:21,917
You'll make a good candidate.

611
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,503
Not by linking arms
with the president's wife.

612
00:43:24,586 --> 00:43:29,341
If I'm a disaster,
it makes for a good campaign ad.

613
00:43:29,424 --> 00:43:31,885
If I do a good job,
nobody can fault you.

614
00:43:31,968 --> 00:43:35,138
Either way,
it doesn't hurt your chances in 2016.

615
00:43:37,098 --> 00:43:40,852
Well, I appreciate you
coming by before going public.

616
00:43:40,936 --> 00:43:44,147
It is classy, and thoughtful.

617
00:43:44,981 --> 00:43:46,983
I won't actively block you.

618
00:43:47,067 --> 00:43:49,486
The rest is on your shoulders.

619
00:43:50,445 --> 00:43:52,614
Thank you, Senator.

620
00:43:53,114 --> 00:43:55,951
Tell the president I'm doing this
out of respect to you.

621
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,162
Frank's still on my shit list
till I beat him in the general.

622
00:43:59,246 --> 00:44:00,664
I will.

623
00:44:01,748 --> 00:44:03,833
Why didn't you come right away?

624
00:44:03,917 --> 00:44:05,961
I had a meeting I couldn't miss.

625
00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:07,546
Fucking Washington.

626
00:44:07,629 --> 00:44:10,090
- This is gonna hurt.
- I know.

627
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:14,427
Ah!

628
00:44:15,053 --> 00:44:17,514
Here's some Percocet.
It'll help with the pain.

629
00:44:18,848 --> 00:44:20,642
I'll write you a 30-day prescription.

630
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:22,102
I can't.

631
00:44:22,185 --> 00:44:24,521
- I'm not supposed to--
- What was that?

632
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,608
Nothing.

633
00:44:37,367 --> 00:44:39,119
All right. You're good to go.

634
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:19,743
Hey.

635
00:45:19,826 --> 00:45:22,287
- How did it go with Mendoza?
- Well, I think.

636
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:23,830
He'll support you?

637
00:45:23,913 --> 00:45:26,333
He won't openly fight it.

638
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:28,585
Well, that is a big step forward.

639
00:45:28,668 --> 00:45:31,379
- How did it go with Doug?
- No real news.

640
00:45:34,132 --> 00:45:35,800
Hey, are you in here again tonight?

641
00:45:35,884 --> 00:45:39,220
I'm still getting over this cold.
I don't want to get you sick.

642
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:41,097
Well, don't stay up
with all that too late.

643
00:45:41,181 --> 00:45:43,266
Francis?

644
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:45,602
When do we announce the nomination?

645
00:45:50,315 --> 00:45:52,609
Listen, I wasn't gonna
bring this up tonight,

646
00:45:52,692 --> 00:45:55,278
but you should know
that there are some serious doubts

647
00:45:55,362 --> 00:45:57,280
from people at the State Department.

648
00:45:57,364 --> 00:45:59,032
You mean Cathy.

649
00:45:59,115 --> 00:46:00,909
And some on her staff.

650
00:46:03,453 --> 00:46:04,621
Like what?

651
00:46:04,704 --> 00:46:08,291
Well, in over your head,
wearing two hats, the obvious things.

652
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:11,503
And are you saying this
because you don't want to move forward?

653
00:46:11,586 --> 00:46:14,672
Not at all. I'm sharing with you
so you fully understand

654
00:46:14,756 --> 00:46:18,051
- what you're getting into.
- And I do.

655
00:46:23,598 --> 00:46:25,683
Maybe we shouldn't rush this.

656
00:46:27,644 --> 00:46:30,772
- You're having doubts now, too.
- I didn't say that.

657
00:46:30,855 --> 00:46:32,607
Only you should put
more thought into whether

658
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:35,527
this is the right move for you.
That's all.

659
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:38,321
Good night, Francis.

660
00:46:40,115 --> 00:46:41,324
Feel better.

661
00:47:53,313 --> 00:47:54,981
Francis.

662
00:47:56,524 --> 00:47:59,194
I want you to announce
the nomination this week.

663
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:02,280
I don't want to wait.
The timing will never be good.

664
00:48:02,363 --> 00:48:03,698
And I don't want to waste time

665
00:48:03,781 --> 00:48:05,783
when I can be getting
real experience under my belt.

666
00:48:05,867 --> 00:48:09,287
So set a date, hold a press conference,
and let's do it.

667
00:48:17,545 --> 00:48:18,796
Claire!

668
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,259
I was not trying to suggest
that you not be the ambassador

669
00:48:23,343 --> 00:48:25,929
- when I brought up Cathy. I was just--
- We made a deal,

670
00:48:26,012 --> 00:48:27,889
and now you're trying
to back away from it.

671
00:48:27,972 --> 00:48:30,058
- That is not true.
- Then you would've told Cathy

672
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:32,018
it's happening
to make her peace with that.

673
00:48:32,101 --> 00:48:34,979
- It's not that simple.
- Yes, it is.

674
00:48:35,063 --> 00:48:38,858
- You're the president.
- I can't control Congress.

675
00:48:38,942 --> 00:48:41,611
I'm trying to get two
major initiatives off the ground

676
00:48:41,694 --> 00:48:43,821
and every move I make
will have an effect.

677
00:48:43,905 --> 00:48:47,367
We agreed to this before we ever
stepped foot in this house.

678
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:50,119
- I know what we agreed to.
- How am I supposed to run for office

679
00:48:50,203 --> 00:48:52,997
at some point if I don't have
a legitimate track record?

680
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:56,543
We have to survive
the next 18 months,

681
00:48:56,626 --> 00:49:00,296
accomplish something,
and then look ahead.

682
00:49:02,173 --> 00:49:04,509
Francis, let's be realistic.

683
00:49:05,635 --> 00:49:08,096
There's no guarantee you'll get elected.

684
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:10,306
I need to be prepared if you don't.

685
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:12,350
You have that much faith in me, do you?

686
00:49:12,433 --> 00:49:14,352
More faith than you have in me,
it seems.

687
00:49:14,435 --> 00:49:16,521
I believe in you
more than anyone, Claire.

688
00:49:16,604 --> 00:49:19,315
Then show it. Nominate me.
I shouldn't have to convince you.

689
00:49:19,399 --> 00:49:20,900
It's not about convincing.

690
00:49:20,984 --> 00:49:24,028
It's about being honest
about the political climate

691
00:49:24,112 --> 00:49:27,365
- that we find ourselves--
- I'm almost 50 years old.

692
00:49:27,448 --> 00:49:29,826
I've been in the passenger seat
for decades.

693
00:49:29,909 --> 00:49:31,619
It's time for me
to get behind the wheel.

694
00:49:31,703 --> 00:49:35,498
That needs to start now.
Before the election.

695
00:49:35,582 --> 00:49:38,334
Because who knows what will happen?
What if you lose?

696
00:49:41,504 --> 00:49:45,300
I will not be
a placeholder president, Claire.

697
00:49:47,135 --> 00:49:51,806
I will win.
And I will leave a legacy.

698
00:49:51,889 --> 00:49:53,641
You mean we will.

699
00:49:53,725 --> 00:49:55,018
Excuse me, sir.

700
00:49:55,101 --> 00:49:57,937
The Secretary of Defense is on the line.
He says it's urgent.

701
00:50:01,733 --> 00:50:02,734
Yes?

702
00:50:04,986 --> 00:50:06,613
Okay.

703
00:50:06,696 --> 00:50:08,156
I'm coming.

704
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:09,782
Not until I get there.

705
00:50:09,866 --> 00:50:11,868
- I'll be right down.
- Yes, sir.

706
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:19,876
Get dressed.
I want you to see something.

707
00:51:17,183 --> 00:51:18,643
Come in.

708
00:51:31,698 --> 00:51:33,533
- Here.
- Thank you.

709
00:51:36,202 --> 00:51:37,578
Okay, great.

710
00:51:38,871 --> 00:51:40,039
Get undressed.

711
00:52:38,306 --> 00:52:40,224
How did this happen?

712
00:52:40,308 --> 00:52:41,976
Doesn't matter.

713
00:52:53,279 --> 00:52:54,864
Let me help you.

714
00:53:05,124 --> 00:53:07,084
Sh... I'll... I'll do it.

715
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:23,017
I'll be gentle.

716
00:53:28,815 --> 00:53:30,817
Don't be gentle.

717
00:53:31,609 --> 00:53:33,110
Like that?

718
00:53:34,111 --> 00:53:35,613
Yeah.

719
00:53:45,623 --> 00:53:48,543
- Oh, whoa! What the fuck?
- It's bourbon.

720
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:51,629
- I--
- That's all. It's just bourbon.

721
00:53:51,712 --> 00:53:53,965
- Take it.
- I really don't want to.

722
00:53:54,048 --> 00:53:56,634
Nothing's going through the skin.

723
00:53:56,717 --> 00:53:59,136
I just want you to squirt it...

724
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,847
into my mouth.

725
00:54:02,056 --> 00:54:04,600
Okay? Please.

726
00:54:15,862 --> 00:54:17,822
- Is that our target?
- Yes, sir.

727
00:54:17,905 --> 00:54:20,867
Mr. President,
this is a highly classified operation--

728
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:23,536
I'm clearing the First Lady
for this operation.

729
00:54:23,619 --> 00:54:25,246
Yes, sir. Forgive me, sir.

730
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:27,206
We are armed and ready, sir.

731
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:30,710
Abdullah is in one of those
vehicles. We can't tell which one.

732
00:54:30,793 --> 00:54:32,461
If they go in
three different directions,

733
00:54:32,545 --> 00:54:35,798
we wouldn't know where to strike, and
if he makes it back to the mountains,

734
00:54:35,882 --> 00:54:37,592
we'll lose our satellite track on him.

735
00:54:38,968 --> 00:54:40,595
Are those children?

736
00:54:40,678 --> 00:54:43,014
I can't say definitely, sir,
but they could be.

737
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:46,893
Do we have authorization, sir?

738
00:54:49,562 --> 00:54:52,607
- Proceed.
- Proceed with the launch.

739
00:54:54,984 --> 00:54:56,777
And ten seconds.

740
00:54:58,529 --> 00:55:03,534
And five, four, three...

741
00:55:13,544 --> 00:55:15,796
Target is destroyed, sir.

742
00:55:18,299 --> 00:55:20,134
Thank you, everyone.

743
00:55:42,698 --> 00:55:44,450
I still want it.

744
00:55:47,495 --> 00:55:48,913
All right.

745
00:55:52,291 --> 00:55:54,001
All right.

746
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:20,674
